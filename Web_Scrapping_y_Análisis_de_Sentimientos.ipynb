            "As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are \"brainwashed\" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.\n"

            "Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.\n"

But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain\\'t the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are \"brainwashed\" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie\\'s solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn\\'t the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don\\'t add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.',\n",
              "  'Margot does the best with what she\\'s given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I\\'m a crotchety old man, I\\'m a woman in my 20s, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m this movie\\'s target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.',\n",
              "  'I do not usually write reviews, but this is beyond description. Last time I wrote a review it was for the absolutely horrible wrinkle in time. This is almost as bad. At least Gosling plays his part well, but the story is abysmal. If you can find anything else to do like watch paint dry, then yes please do. You will save your brain cells the agony of a painful slow ..... nearly two hours long this was mind-numbing storytelling at its mediocre worst. How many ways can I say do not go see it if you have a choice. See anything else but this exercise in horrendous cliches and exaggerated self-importance. If I could give it negative 10 stars I would.',\n",
              "  'As much as it pains me to give a movie called \"Barbie\" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I\\'m a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don\\'t agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that\\'s ok. This movie wasn\\'t designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I\\'ll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.',\n",
              "  \"I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism & how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.( SPOILERS AHEAD )Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..\",\n",
              "  \"I thought this would be so much different. The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men. Which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people.\",\n",
              "  \"Before making Barbie (2023),Greta Gerwigsingle-handedly directed two films:Lady Bird (2017)andLittle Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played byMargot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows isThe Wizard of Oz (1939)journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way ofThe Truman Show (1998)orStranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.\",\n",
              "  \"Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again.\",\n",
              "  \"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.\",\n",
              "  'I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can\\'t be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term \"Marvel speak.\" If you\\'ve watched anything made in the past 15 years you\\'ll recognize it right away: \"You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it\\'s so awkward that it\\'s funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it\\'s staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!\"The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie\\'s Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It\\'s given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.',\n",
              "  \"It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.8/10.\",\n",
              "  \"My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction.\",\n",

I left the movie fealing like I learned nothing knew. The movie is trying to be this inclusive thing but with all the jokes directing into the old steriotypes it contradicted its self the hold time. Margot is beyond beautiful and calling her self ugly in the movie even though she is \"The Barbie\" isn\\'t so clevver as they think it is, not even with the narrator. I Love Greta but it dosen\\'t feel like her. Kinda like with Wednesday not feeling like a Tim Burton thing. But good job with the marketing, it got me.',\n",

It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.\",\n",

And margot robbie come on... the perfect casting for Barbie. I also have to say, the way they created Barbie land was so amazing, it just makes you just want to there. I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. I can understand not everyone will love it. But i am sure it is a iconic film already.\",\n",

The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down. One positive is that it had some funny parts, but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline!!\",\n",

              "  'I walked out of the theatre thinking, \"Yeah, I had a good time in that movie\". But as the day went on I kind had that \"Ok, that kebab probably wasn\\'t a good idea.\"The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she\\'s not as perfect as she\\'s been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he\\'s ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don\\'t know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That\\'s a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it\\'s just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don\\'t take this film too seriously, then maybe you\\'ll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?',\n",
              "  \"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).\",\n",

The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish.

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie. Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing. I came away disappointed, but not totally disgusted either.\",\n",
              "  \"Barbie, a movie about the beloved doll and all her identities and her friends, what could go wrong? A lot apparently. It started with voice over narration and went downhill from there. There was too much telling rather than showing. Most of this movie constantly explained everything and often told me how I should feel about it. The writing felt like it was trying too hard to be profound and tried to oversimplify complex subjects and gender roles. There were some funny moments, but a lot of the humor and story were far from subtle. I never felt drawn into the characters and what they were experiencing. The story lacked stakes. I didn't care about Barbie or Ken. In the right hands, this movie could have been fun. But Barbie didn't seem to know what it wanted to be or what story it wanted to tell.\",\n",

I couldn\\'t stand it. Barbie\\'s world and attitude was a constant bummer. Ken\\'s attitude was sour. For the next hour (and more) the movie just lived in negativity.I bought tickets to this show a month ago. And, I saw it the day before the official opening day. I was very excited about this movie. And, I was playing the music (Dua Lipa) song almost every day. I was really excited for this movie - and was looking forward to something very positive. But, the vast majority of the movie was the \"conflict\" part of the writing. It was just too much! The movie didn\\'t need to go that way, that far, that fast. I would have preferred a more shallow and fun Barbie movie vs. This Barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict.',\n",

As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I\\'m glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig\\'s latest directorial venture, \"Barbie,\" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig\\'s live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie\\'s role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I\\'m giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.',\n",
              "  \"Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.\",\n",

But the fact that some people in the audience (and I\\'d wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn\\'t bother to watch the movie) don\\'t want to hear it, doesn\\'t make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don\\'t like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn\\'t that \"women rule and men drool\" - it\\'s that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that\\'s true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point. Patriarchy may give men privilege but it ultimately hurts them, too - pressuring them to conform to a rigid idea of manhood and silencing their self-expression.I am living for the fact that this movie is unapologetic about showing the absurdity of it all. I would have given it a 10 if it weren\\'t for the cringe worthy Ken dance number. It was the only weak part of the movie. But otherwise, Bravo!',\n",

It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again.

That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you\\'re not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon.

Er what?Reviews for this were glowingly positive and I pretty much disagreed with all of them, but even the negative reviews praised the set design and Barbie land, personally I didn't see the big deal, like they copied how the dream houses look and made a set of it. Whoopty do.The two stars are mostly for Ryan Gosling and Allan (I forget the actors name) as they were the best part of the movie, even though Gosling Ken strolling was sad to me.

It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife.

What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised.

I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary.

It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids.

And if you have a teen at home, take her with you. Barbie goes from fun to introspection and I love a good comedy that makes you think.

What started out as amusing is so committed to a shot-for-shot homage it becomes a sinister, disturbing message that closely matches 2001's statement of the human race discovering weapons.A chase scene in an office makes no sense.A key character at her kitchen table is a touching moment but the way she is found has no internal logic.Having seen this film with various friends I noticed audiences were left cold at same points.Why would Ken run into plastic moulded waves in an environment he lives in? One of many 'jokes' that fails to land such as the cartoon car crashes, the boardroom whisper gag among others.The movie has some cute moments having people enact doll play.That absence of internal logic reveals this movie has no idea what it wants to be.\",\n",

Now everything in the movies and TV shows is perceived as preachy, not everything is a conspiracy, people need to consider that movies and TV shows at its core, and specially the good ones, are about sharing perspectives and allow the audience, if their minds are opened to it, to acknowledge all sides of the stories.So let's start with the actual review, Greta Gerwig seems to have found an actual legitimate story for the type of message she delivered, contrary to most criticism I didn't find the movie preachy or biased at all, I actually felt it was incredibly balanced and the message made sense considering the plot. Sometimes I do agree that these (for some reason) delicate social topics tend to be pushed into films because a lot of studio directors want to align with trends to make a few more dollars, but in this particular film I didn't felt that at all!It's a fictional story that has the ability to tell a bit of historical context of one of the most (if not the most) famous dolls in the world and how it impacted the world culture and how it actually affected women's image with its controversial decisions.The other aspect of this fictional story is providing perspective, of how women are perceived and treated in our society, the rooted systemic issues we tend to ignore AND with the Barbie plot device provide some fun and interesting analogy of how society would be if it was the other way around and women were the ones holding most power.But again there's no hidden dark meaning, it's just a woman's perspective and if you think about it, even though reality change a lot considering the country where you live, it's not that ridiculous, the story is ultimately about equality and its a fun innocent approach to it.Margot Robbie is insanely talented and its amazing to watch her portray this role, for once I am hoping that we keep the dialogue opened and stop inventing false theories .\",\n",

Until she\\'s not. And she\\'s becomes accustomed to our culture. The perspective of an otherwise perfect doll born from a matriarchy is wholly interesting and captivating as we laugh, hate and cry throughout the movie. Barbie must find out what is wrong with her owner but in doing so she discovers imperfect humanity and falls in love with it. This is the story and it is told brilliantly.There is no need to mention the phenomenal performances by each and every actor in this film. The set design, the costumes, the cinematography are all a testament to Greta Gerwigs skill as a director.To view this film as merely a feminist blockbuster is to ignore the fact that feminism is not just woman\\'s problem but a humanity\\'s problem. This is what the movie displays. Go into it with an open mind and you will see that it does not preach for women to rule men but for men and women to discover themselves without being pressured by the culture around them. A message which needs to be broadcast across the world in a time of such needless division.We are all forced to live like dolls in this world and we must escape from this and discover ourselves. It is amazing to see Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach tackle such daring themes and pull it off. The comedy throughout provided by celebrity cameos and hilarious satire is spot on.The soundtrack is astounding and in particular Billie Eilish\\'s song \"What was I made for?\" is a fantastic close to the journey of discovery that Barbie and Ken have been through.A brilliant achievement in modern film making that makes me hopeful for the future as we tackle more and more complex issues head on - rather than watch boring old men debate uselessness on YouTube.',\n",

The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all.

Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality.

The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well.

Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong.

Ryan Gosling never failed to make me laugh in his role as Ken, he was perfect for this role and I can't imagine anyone else fulfilling it to the same standard. The supporting Barbies and Kens also excelled in their roles adding to the character and world of Barbie.I have spent some time reading other reviews which have complained that the 3rd portion of the movie was too heavy handed in its feminist perspective and that its blunt political message didn't properly encapsulate Barbie. To that I say; The 3rd portion is less than 40 minutes long, if you can't listen to women's issues for that little time without getting bored then maybe you're not getting what we're saying. And this movie was actually about Barbie, unlike the animated Barbie movies which merely starred Barbie. This movie is actually about Barbie and her extensive history as a controversial doll that had to fight tooth and nail to make it into the hands of little girls and inspire them to be more than mothers.Overall, Barbie was incredible and I hope she inspires even more little girls through this movie than she already has.\",\n",

However, it failed to live up to expectations, falling flat just like *spoiler Barbie's heels.The script initially captured the essence of little girls playing with their Barbie dolls, evoking a sense of nostalgia. Barbie dolls were once seen as limitless in their potential, inspiring young girls to explore various careers and fields, including STEM-based jobs. She helped promote young girls interest in science, engineering, math, and technology to hopefully bridge gender gaps in these fields. Barbie encouraged girls to dream big, fostered a love for learning and promoted self-confidence.Barbie symbolizes beauty and fashion-forwardness, allowing young girls to express themselves and embrace their individuality through styling their dolls. Playing with Barbies also promoted emotional intelligence, empathy, creativity, and problem-solving as girls created their own storylines and engaged in role-playing.Regrettably, this movie seemed to disregard the sentimental value associated with the traditional Barbie doll. Instead of embracing themes of friendship, teamwork, feminism, and self-discovery, the film failed to deliver. The friendships between the Barbie characters felt superficial, lacking depth. Rather than promoting equality and dismantling the patriarchy, the movie shifted to a full blown matriarchal focus, missing an opportunity to advocate for gender equality and alliances. There's a monologue by America Ferrera's character that just feels like a very negative view point on being a woman today. I thought it would start that way then maybe turn back toward how beautiful it is to be a woman... but it never did.In the spirit of equality, I also had high hopes this film would promote Barbie and not just a girls toy, but a great toy for any kid (girl or boy). It didn't go there at all.One aspect that felt problematic was the portrayal of Barbie and Ken's relationship, which verged on being toxic. It was evident that Barbie did not reciprocate Ken's feelings, creating an uncomfortable dynamic. The movie missed an opportunity to address this issue and explore the importance of open communication and respecting others' feelings. Ken, was extremely co-dependent and Barbie just saw him as an accessory. Yet when the tables were turned she didn't really learn anything from that.In terms of humor, the movie fell short of expectations. Most of the funny lines that appeared in the trailer seemed to be the highlights, leaving the rest of the film lacking in comedic impact. Additionally, the Ken dolls singing and fighting montage felt out of place, adding nothing substantial to the plotline. It came across as awkward and disconnected, failing to contribute meaningfully to the story.Overall, the film missed opportunities to address important relationship dynamics and deliver consistent humor, leaving these aspects underdeveloped and unsatisfying for the viewers.Additionally, Barbie's journey of self-discovery felt underwhelming, culminating in an anticlimactic ending at the gynecologist's office. It would have been more impactful if her desire to become human stemmed from her longing to share the qualities that Barbie stands for with the real world: friendship, kindness, perseverance, self-expression, and imagination. Sure she's 'ordinary real-world' Barbie but that doesn't mean she can't have extraordinarily character. The story just seemed to glaze over the opportunity to drive home a real lesson for the audience.Overall, I had really high expectations and this movie fell short in my book.\",\n",

The movie pits women against men and it has a negative and political messaging. It\\'s a \"lecturing feminist\" and \"bring down the patriarchy\" kind of movie. I wasn\\'t expecting it to turn out this way from the trailers and was honestly surprised by it.In general, if you\\'re looking for a lighthearted movie about Barbies (and Kens) where you can kick back, relax and have some laughs, this movie is not it.',\n",
              "  'For a film like \"Barbie\" to succeed, every aspect had to come together perfectly. It needed to consummately balance satire with fun, the casting had to be spot-on, and the writing/directing required to pull off such a feat would need to be exquisite. Somewhat remarkably, that is exactly what writer/director Greta Gerwig pulls off here to create the best movie of summer 2023.For a very basic overview, \"Barbie\" sees its titular character (played by Margot Robbie) living her stereotypically perfect life in Barbieland. Well, that is until she is plagued by those pesky intrusive thoughts of death, a flattening of her perfectly-heeled feet, and a trip to Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) to figure out what is going on. As it turns out, a rift has developed between Barbieland and the real world that only Stereotypical Barbie--accompanied by Beach Ken (Ryan Gosling)--can mend. But when Barbie & Ken have extremely different experiences in the real world, it leads to even more messiness between the worlds that precipitates further adventure/hijinks.In terms of plot, somehow Gerwig manages to write and direct her way into the perfect tone with \"Barbie\". A mere mention of the term \"patriarchy\" in today\\'s polarized landscape will more often than not lead to a line in the sand that neither side will cross, yet Gerwig perfectly examines and satirizes the subject by making the proceedings just so darn fun. Much like, say, Jordan Peele before her did with horror flicks like \"Get Out\" or \"Us\", Gerwig uses a genre other than straight-up drama to get her satire and story themes across here. Sometimes, that proves to be the best \"delivery service\" and it is certainly true in this case.Of course, solid/unique actors are required to carry out this quirky film\\'s shenanigans and softer moments, and \"Barbie\" comes up aces in that department too. Robbie is perfectly cast as the lead, with both her beauty and dramatic acting chops lending themselves to the film\\'s own dual nature. But more often than not it is Gosling who steals the show every time he\\'s on screen. To do what Gerwig wants to do with \"Barbie\", the Ken role has to be perfect--and is here in the versatile style of Gosling (one of Hollywood\\'s most underappreciated acting talents). The rest of the cast is also filled with solid performances and wonderfully fun cameos.\"Barbie\" is just as much a visual treat as anything else--they didn\\'t short the area of pink paint for no reason. DP Rodrigo Pieto creates a universe that is a sight to behold in every frame and then transitions some of those characters into a real-world environment with similar panache. All of this is of course given some drive by a killer soundtrack featuring the likes of Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, and even Gosling himself!Not only do I feel that \"Barbie\" eclipsed (even if narrowly in some cases) the bigger blockbusters like \"The Flash\", \"Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 1\", & \"Oppenheimer\", but it subsequently vaulted Gerwig into the upper echelon of my must-see writers/directors (alongside Nolan, Villeneuve, Peele, etc.). After not knowing exactly what to expect from this film going in, I was utterly blown away by this experience.',\n",
              "  '\"Barbie\" is a movie that is setting all sorts of records, so it\\'s obvious that the film is touching many people. For some, it\\'s the fun of seeing a doll come to life, for others it\\'s the theme of empowerment that make the movie a big hit. As for me, I did like it and thought it was a pretty good movie...but it\\'s not for everyone.The first 2/3 of the film are simply fun and a visual delight. Seeing all the Barbie\\'s in Barbieland was a joy. It also was very nice seeing Barbie enter the real world and interact with all the unfamiliar aspects of it. As for the final third, for me, this is what hurt the film a bit...at least for some viewers. Why? Well, I loved its message of female empowerment but I also felt it was delivered like a sledgehammer. Instead of talking about it and getting on with the plot, the movie bogged down for me and seemed to keep making the same point repeatedly. Subtle, it was not. On the other hand, who am I to complain...I did like the movie and am glad it had a nice feminist bent. Obviously this worked for many women seeing the film. Overall, a very good movie that slowed to a crawl towards the end. Not bad...but a film I wanted to like more than I actually did.',\n",
              "  \"This movie is everything and more. It's comedic, colorful, entertaining, heartfelt, nostalgic, and has such a truly meaningful message that's fit for everyone.While the movie pokes fun at the patriarchy, it's a beautifully written commentary on how the patriarchy affects everyone, not just women. Where Ryan Gosling's Ken was struggling to find who he really is, because the patriarchy forces him into masculinity. There's also the more obvious example of the Barbies being brainwashed into servitude.As marvelously played by Margot Robbie, Barbie feels the struggles that many women face - where we feel lost at some point in our lives. America Ferrera's monologue on how women are always criticized on every detail of their lives was extraordinary. This movie positively shows the beauty of womanhood.Barbie will definitely become a classic and a movie that will be talked about for many years to come!\",\n",

Like the message was literally forced in your face. It seemed lazy to me. I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had've taken some elements from it because it would've made it much more powerful if so. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up. Overall for me it's a 6/10. Good film but that's all. Definitely could've been less preachy. Ultimately, it's nice movie to see and I'd see it again at some point but it wasn't great.\",\n",
              "  'The story in Barbie isn\\'t about a doll. It\\'s about reconciling the imperfect world we live in with the idealized stories we tell and create. We use our dolls, toys, and play to create those stories. We internalize the ideals shared through those stories. Sometimes they are good ideals that empower us. Sometimes they are toxic ideals that disempower us. Ultimately they are created by us and we are influenced by them.We created them, and we can change them. We can make them what ever we want them to be. We can make ourselves what ever we want to be. The tag line for the barbie doll is \"You can be anything.\" That in the point of the movie. You can be anything.',\n",

And before you say I\\'m a crotchety old man, l\\'m in my 20s, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m this movie\\'s target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.',\n",

It seems like a fun movie with a very deep meaning behind, the ending was very unexpected and gave a twist very similar to the truman show.\",\n",
              "  'My Review - Barbie\\nIn Cinemas now\\nMy Rating 6.5/10I\\'ve been keenly looking forward to seeing this much publicised movie because I\\'m a great fan of Margo Robbie, Ryan Gosling and Greta Gerwig\\'s work.I held the opinion from first hearing about it that it was either going to be brilliant and I\\'d love it or a huge disappointment and I\\'d loathe it in other words no in between for me.How ever that\\'s not the case I didn\\'t love it and I didn\\'t loathe it I have to accept that I\\njust didn\\'t get it ?Perhaps it\\'s because that I\\'m a 70 plus baby boomer male who felt that the strong feminist message directed towards the predominantly heterosexual male patriarchy for me was just preaching to the converted .Barbie is a comedy fantasy which certainly packs a not so subtle feminist smack in the face of the men who devalue the equality and contribution that women play in our society but they won\\'t see Barbie.The audience on this special preview was young mainly women and they seemed to get the jokes that I didn\\'t and seemed to react very well to the movie applauding at the conclusion.No spoilers about the plot you should judge it yourself as the story is not as simple as the trailer portrays it to be. Barbie and Ken leave the other Barbies and Ken\\'s behind in Barbieland to venture through a portal caused by a stereotypical Barbie played to perfection by Margo Robbie . Barbie is experiencing disturbing emotions that she has to explore further in the real world of humans to understand in an effort to retain her eternal optimism.Ken her buff nerdy and needy boyfriend played by Ryan Gosling joins Barbie on her quest to travel through the portal landing at Venice Beach California complete with roller skates only to discover that the values and gender roles of Barbie land are reversed in the real world . The question for both the surprised dolls is which world do they want to live in?Pink cloud sunny Barbie land where every day is the same and perfect or the human world of Corporate greed and misogyny where you grow old and die?Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both are impressive and their comedy timing adds a light touch to the darker undertone of the film.Barbie for me has some entertaining moments but they were melting moments for me and while I hope it\\'s popular for the creators of the movie I\\'m left puzzled at what audience it\\'s aimed at ?The male population that Greta Gerwig cleverly parodies through Ken and his Ken buddies certainly wouldn\\'t see her movie and I think the Disney generation of under 15 would be bored .I did enjoy the technical aspects of Barbie and the incredible amount of research and effort that has gone into producing this very expensive would be box office blockbuster.I also enjoyed homage to great movies of the past like Stanley Kubric\\'s 2001 A Space Odysee , Saturday Night Fever, and of course The Wizard of Oz .It\\'s one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and has been in the pipeline for over a decade and in 2018 after little action was passed into the hands of Warner Bros then in 2019 they finally announced Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig as the lead actor-director duo for this film.Director Greta Gerwig co wrote the screenplay with her partner with Noah Baumbach basing their story on the famous Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel . It is the first live action Barbie film so a lot of creative reputations are dependent on its success .Mattel, the toy company that created Barbie obviously approved of the movie getting screen credit and representation in Greta Gerwig\\'s clever perhaps to clever script.Mattel contributed input towards the set design of the film keeping the old-school charm of the Barbie world intact and I suspect there will be a surge in sales as all the famous Barbie dolls get a mention in this film.Noah Baumbach is Executive Producer as well as his partner Greta Gerwig and Margo Robbie the movies effervescent star are all producers on this project that has an estimated production budget of $145 million US$.Margo Robbie has been quoted as saying \"that the film\\'s aim is to subvert expectations and give audiences \"the thing you didn\\'t know you wanted.I\\'m not so sure about that statement as Barbie didn\\'t reach my expectations and I felt the thing I didn\\'t know I wanted wasn\\'t what I wanted at all.Top marks to Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto who created a unique color palette for the film that Greta Gerwig named \"Techni-Barbie,\" after the Technicolor format. Also top marks to two time Academy Award Winner designer Jacqueline Durran. It\\'s a given that costumes would be one of the most important factors about the movie,',\n",
              "  'I had great expectations for the Barbie movie, mainly because of the writers (Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach) and the stellar cast with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the way. Unfortunately I found myself disappointed, bored and shocked by some messages the movie tries to convey.Starting with what I liked, the performances were great and in particular Ryan Gosling was spectacular with a wide range of emotions and a lot of humor displayed. Also the design of the sets was inspired with a lot of references to the Barbie world and the style was unique and recognisable. Finally some jokes landed pretty well and the movie (in the first half) is pretty funny. And the positives end here.Unfortunately the negatives are much more important. Sorted in a order of increasing gravity:\\n* some plot lines are bad and are closed so quickly that it would have been better not to include them in the first place. In particular I am referring to the mother/daughter one and the one about Mattel. Furthermore, the Mattel one is also a bit strange since it is useful to criticise however uses feminism to make money, while being a movie that does exactly that.* the film becomes boring in the second half. This is due to a systematic shift in tone and style since if in the first part the satire is sharp and elegant and leads to numerous bittersweet laughs, in the second half instead the movie becomes full of exposition. There are a lot of scenes where things are directly explained to the viewer (clearly considered a bit stupid) and there are some too long monologues that are both cringe and painfully written. This is a pity because some ideas explored in the second half are interesting, but due to this shift \"Barbie\" becomes so boring to enjoy them.* the messages: I found some messages the movie is trying to convey pretty baffling. First of all the film is not about parity, but rather about gender fight and I don\\'t think this is the correct idea to give to younger viewers. I want that children/young adults get that as a society we want equal rights and opportunities, not to fight to be the dominant genere. This is also true because of the fact that there\\'s no a single positive male figure throughout the movie because they are all treated like enemies or like total idiots. On the other side the Barbies are perfect entities. In a certain way it seemed \"Birds of Prey\" where the situation was exactly the same but in that case there weren\\'t two of the biggest writer in Hollywood behind. Not to mention the totally worst thing that is how the Barbie solve the main conflict: instead of using intelligence they use seduction. This is so wrong because in a movie that wants to be empowering, women are depicted as better suited in seducing instead of thinking. All of these ruin other good ideas like for instance the inversion of the point of view that is useful to explain to men what women in our society has to live every day. That was pretty interesting but it gets lost between what mentioned before.In conclusion, I was very disappointed by the \"Barbie\" movie because I actually had high hopes knowing that it could have been a fun movie with positive messages, but it was the total opposite. I\\'ve seen it with both females and males and the reactions were generally mixed and no gender pattern was evidenced in terms of appreciating it or not. However the great merit that I have to give credit to the movie is that it triggers a discussion capable of actually enrich people through sharing of experiences. And so, even if I didn\\'t like it I\\'d suggest you to watch \"Barbie\" and discuss of it with your families and friends!',\n",
              "  \"This movie is not for people who cry a lot. It was a beautiful movie with proper cinematic gold.Starting with Barbie land, it showed the complete difference between a patriarcy and a matriarcy. While the Barbies are in control there Is a lack of violence between the Kens and the Barbies. The most toxic thing is a jealousy broken between Ryan Goslings Ken and Simu Liu's Ken. Although, the Kens all work partially sexualising jobs like cheerleaders and stupid jobs like 'beach' which is a role reversal of the human world. Barbie's entire world focuses on a routine and when that routine is disrupted we see Barbie spiral out of control.Side note: the whole concept of weird Barbie's house is amazing, the discontinued Barbie's and Ken's are hilarious especially when you realise their backstories.Then the human world is depicted with both bad elements and good elements. Under this patriarchy we see both women and men being incredibly toxic and awful. Barbie gets continuously catcalled and even assaulted showing the harsh reality of what women like us actually go through. We also see Barbie experience true emotion seeing friends laughing together and an old woman on a bench which kinda made me cry a bit. This is when Ken partially learns about the patriarchy and starts to want more. The sequences in the human world aren't as interesting as Barbie world but still keep you hooked in.Then going back to Barbie world we see Ken's patriarchy. Unlike the Barbie's matriarchy it is completely toxic. The Barbies are all maids and 'stupid' only ever caring for the Kens. And then the Kens actually start a war with eachother over the Barbies. However the Kens are actually stupid and clearly don't see what they want. Ryan Gosling's Ken then explains to Barbie that he didn't like how he was treated before and he doesn't like the world he's built for himself now, and they settle on the opposite of the actual human world. The Barbies still run everything but they give the Kens more opportunities (the Kens ask for some supreme court positions and they get told they can have lower down positions). This is the opposite to the human world where the men have all the high up positions but at least women get to vote now.....Finally the ending where Barbie is taken away by Ruth is beautiful. This made me cry the most, watching all these things that makes us human and balling my eyes out. This movie is a masterpiece and deserves the Oscar this year more than any other.\",\n",
              "  \"I was really surprised about how much i liked Ryan Gosling in this. I had totally forgot about his comedic talent and timing. The movie works. There is definitely a moral message in this, even though I believe the majority of viewers will be too distracted by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings great performances and all of the comedy elements in this and the fact that the script is hardly worth being filmed. I feel like with a different script they could have created something truly great.Over all it's a fun family movie to enjoy together. I watched this and afterwards Oppenheimer last night and I am truly glad I did it in that order, because I doubt that I would have been able to enjoy this even nearly as much if I had watched Oppenheimer first.\",\n",
              "  'Mrs. Shullivan and I enjoyed about the first 30 minutes of this full length feature film but after about the third song and dance number by the various Ken\\'s we agreed that Ryan Gosling appeared to be the main character and not Barbie.Don\\'t get me wrong, both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie performed their respective doll like rolls of Ken and Barbie with a well balanced comedic and realistic delivery but when the producers appeared to display the Ryan Gosling \"Ken doll\" with an enhanced CGI eight (8) pack abdomen and bulging biceps we thought to ourselves that this was more of a vanity project for Ryan Gosling rather than an opportunity to reflect the changing world and the advancement of feminism through Barbie\\'s vision of the changing world.The visuals in multi colored pastels reminded me of the 1960\\'s Elvis films such as Blue Hawaii since Barbie and Elvis were popular icons within the same era. The downside of the Barbie film was that her message of being your own person and not being reliant on a man seemed to get lost by the multiple song and dance numbers provided to the ensemble cast of the male Ken dolls.All in all it was a decent film, not to be considered a future film classic, nor a memorable Ryan Goslng or Margot Robbie performance worthy of an Academy Award but just like Barbie it may be remembered today as a memorable place in time from a long past era. It would not surprise me to see a TV producer turn this Barbie film into a franchise merchandise bonanza and a weekly 30 minute TV sitcom which in my humble opinion is about all it could hold Mrs. Shullivan and my own attention for.I give the film a decent 6 out of 10 IMDb rating.',\n",

It's the best version of itself and just immensely satisfying that the Barbie movie that got made on this scale is so weird and unique.Margot Robbie is perfect casting as Barbie, she nails the movement and switches between the eccentric Barbie Land and more emotionally tolling real world effortlessly. She has a terrific arc that's full of emotionally resonant moments and the almost parental nature with Gosling works beautifully.Ryan Gosling is phenomenal as Ken. Note perfect casting that gives him another welcome chance to move away from his usual introverted roles and tap into his impeccable comedic timing present in The Nice Guys, only here it's dialed up to eleven. It all culminates in a musical number that is painfully funny.Will Ferrell is essentially playing Lord Business again and him and his whole team of execs are just as cartoonish as the people in Barbie Land but it actually really works as a nice bit of satire that emphasises just how out of touch all of them are.America Ferrara gets one of the biggest speeches of the film and really makes it work and her relationship with Ariana Greenblatt adds a lot of heart to the film whilst allowing it to have its both ways when it comes to acknowledging the history of Barbie.Greta Gerwig's direction is excellent, getting the bigger budget she absolutely deserves and uses every penny. Magnificent dance numbers, a fun car chase and a Barbie Land that is as vibrant as possible and despite fully embracing its own artificial nature it feels more real and visually stunning than so much of what's out there.The soundtrack is another standout element, a great selection of songs from some of the best artists currently working all at the top of their game. Like the film, some are just really fun, some are very profound and every single one fits in effortlessly.\",\n",

His character, Ken, also happened to be well written.On the other hand, Barbie was a disappointing character. Margot Robbie was good enough. Even though there was nothing special about her performance, she wasn\\'t the problem. It\\'s just her arc was weakly written. The motivations used to drive the story forward were fragile and questionable. Her development at the end did not make sense. She wanted to become a human yet she only experienced the real world for like a few hours, during which she didn\\'t go through any challenges or experiences to reach such conclusion in the end. She didn\\'t even save the day; her owner did. It felt like Barbie was a supporting character in her own movie.Ken stole the show for the most part.

We watched the whole thing, found nothing to discuss in the usual post-movie family recap, and went on about our lives. When the Oscars noms were announced and Barbie got nominated in the music categories, I couldn't even remember any songs! Oh yes, then I remembered that dance thing at the beginning (where Barbie has her 'death' comment). Okay, it had a song.

It totally could have been. This movie has a huge budget. Then why such a mediocre story at best? I\\'m not saying it was a bad movie as well, but it was just \"ok\". Just that.Nowadays movies have become nothing else but live-actions, sequels and prequels.

The message shoved in your face way too much and isnt subtle at all, characters that are set up early on are completely forgotten by the 3rd act in a bloated script filled with unnecissarily complex feministic views. For a movie about a children's toy, the dialogue is often much too complex and theres no way in hell a child is going to be able to understand whats going on; several lines left me scratching my head as the dialogue is way too overly complex. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are excellent casting choices with Gosling going above and beyond, nailing all of the comedic moments and elevating all of the material he was given to work with.For a movie I was incredibly excited for, I was severely let down and honestly cannot say I recommend this movie to anyone.

Barbie has an idealistic and perfect outlook towards life which gets crushed and she is forced to accept, then gradually embrace and finally manoeuvre through.The film is also vastly political in nature (not just gender but otherwise too), compelling the idealistic society to realise how fractured their own internal workings are resulting in them implementing real life political resolutions to their systems.There are so many more layers to peel off of the writing which elevates this movie from a straightforward comedy/satire to a film that deserves to be broken apart piece by piece and studied extensively for generations to come (sooo very similar to American Psycho).And finally, Ryan Gosling does indeed deliver the absolute most sublime performance of his career.',\n",

It has a wonderful creative voice and a beautiful mix of comedy and respectfully addresses hard topics in a way that I think everyone can benefit from. I can understand how some people find it preachy but I disagree because this is a love letter to women. There are so many things that stuck with me and I will probably remember forever. I am impressed with the amount or detail, creativity, and love that was so obviously put into this movie. Greta Gerwig and the rest of the production team did a beautiful job creating an immersive thought provoking experience that brought me to tears. This is by far Margot and Ryan's best performance I've seen and they deserve all the love for it. The sci-fi references are also a very interesting touch that I didn't expect.

Suddenly everyone can jump around between two worlds and no one thinks that's crazy actually.Suddenly the difference between Kens, Barbies and Human beings is gone away ALTHOUGH in the beginning it shows definite differences like feet or fingers that aren't separate. Later on Ken plays the guitar and can move every single finger for example. All in all the great love for detail from the beginning is gone quite fast and turns into a long childish and boring battle between manly men and fimaly females. It starts to look like the TV-show Love Island. A loud unnecessary back and forth between genders. At the end a try of a deep scene to let go a few deep words and that's it. The movie teaches nothing to take home with. It's more like the name BARBIE was abused for this one in my eyes.\",\n",
              "  'To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. The movie starts fine which is more or less what was advertised in the trailers where the setting was Barbie. That was kind of fun. The problem is that the second part is just a mess in pace, it tries tooooo hard to be funny. The main message of the movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly. It was nowhere close to be succint. All Pixar movies do a better job at making their point. And for me, the worst of all, is that it tried to be controversial so hard that it became stale and dull after some minutes since everything centered around the same topic.Movies should try to unite not divide. At least create some discussion rather than being a one-way discussion where the writer basically tells everything.Parents: Not recommended to bring kids, it is not for them. It can be dull and the jokes are not aimed at that audience.Despite all of these problems, it deserves points for the first 30 mins of the movie, and the aesthetic.',\n",
              "  'It was nostalgic, hilarious, esthetically orgasmic and very moving. It covered all generations of Barbie, which was my hands down favorite toy as a kid. It also touched on the female experience in a really welcoming, wonderful way. I felt it included aspects of the male experience that are important as well. Awesome soundtrack, AMAZING SETS, and wardrobes. The cast was amazing, the writing was perfect, such an original, unique stroy line. If you\\'re going to criticize this movie for going \"against your political beliefs\" then you don\\'t deserve this movie anyways. Women are allowed to talk about the female experience and Barbie was a great way to do it! I just saw it 2 days ago and I really want to see it again!!',\n",
              "  \"A good laugh of a film poking fun at Mattel, complicating the concept of Barbie while at the same time highligting the patriarchy and it's inherent incompatibility with human emancipation.The irony is that the fillmmakers at the same time found it necessary to depict men in a insanely sterotypical fashion. One might argue this is not the case since it is mostly Ken's that are depicted this way. But since the Ken's behaviour are supposed to reflect the human female's experiences of men in general, that argument falls flat.In Short, enjoyable film, but as a discussion on the shortcomings of our present patriarchal society it is disappointing.\",\n",
              "  \"I wanted to like it. But I just didn't. The story wasn't very compelling to me because it seemed as if the entire point of much of the movie was to provide learning moments for viewers with some slapstick comedy and quick-delivery comedy. The story itself should nearly always be more important.All of the goofiness largely would have been excused to me if the comedic moments were really funny. And the way this film was hyped made me think it was going to be super funny. But I rarely laughed. And that's even more of a shame given the talent assembled for the cast. There also weren't many surprising reveals to the audience when maybe there could have been if things were presented differently.I also found it annoying to see Will Farrell play a similar part to what he played in the Lego Movie. Sure he's a CEO rather than a dad. But he was filling the same evil disciplinarian adult role for a movie about a kid's toy. It just felt lazy to not cast someone else for that part, and just made me wish the movie was able to provide the humor and intrigue that the first Lego movie provided to its audience.I'd rather this film felt like a comedy or dramatic experience which has some relevant takes on feminism and culture than thinly veiled sermon with occasional jokes that land amongst a ton that didn't land.I also felt like the movie had way too many characters and ideas thrown together. There was Barbie, Ken, many other Barbies, many other Kens, the crazy Barbie, the CEOs, the mother, the teen, the narrator and more. And it's not just that they had all of these characters. They also tried to have some learning moments delivered-by or delivered-to a majority of these characters. I felt like they would have been better off trying to deliver all these lessons over 3-5 movies rather than 1. And obviously you don't want it ever to seem like the lessons are being delivered but experiences through the story and the consequences of the actions and stakes created by the characters' decisions. Instead there didn't seem like any stakes because the Barbies didn't seem to fit in the real world and the real people didn't fit in the Barbie world.Honestly my favorite part of the movie was a lot of the Easter egg stuff about odd Barbie products over the years. And Easter eggs shouldn't be the best part of any movie. They should be a bonus to the overall experience of the story.\",\n",

It\\'s amazing that a film centered around a toy managed to shed light on the genuine highs and lows of being human, making it a refreshing watch! It was funny, visually stunning, emotionally resonant and engaging. I\\'m not sure why some have labeled it as \"preachy\" or \"agenda-driven,\" because it merely highlighted the realities faced by women today. If these aspects were challenging to watch, that might have been the film\\'s intent - to resonate with its target audience. I appreciate that the movie reminds us what Barbie\\'s original purpose was, to empower girls around the world! So to everyone who feels that this movie was a personal attack, it might be best for you to stop over analyzing every little thing because you weren\\'t the target audience anyway. Highly recommend!!',\n",
              "  \"Barbie lives in Barbie Land with all the other Barbies. Ken is competing with all the other Kens for Barbie's attention. For Barbie it's quite the perfect world. Then Barbie starts to have thoughts of death and bad things start to happen.A reasonably fun, though wildly uneven and muddled, film. The concept and setting are very imaginative and the continuity of the Barbie Land concept is fairly consistent. The film is quite funny with some top notch jokes and scenes.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are perfectly cast as Barbie and Ken and the remaining cast give solid support.The plot is quite muddled though, going in all sorts of random directions. It would have been okay if it was random for the sake of fun but writer-director Greta Gerwig is determined to throw in divisive messaging wherever she can. It brings down what could have been a fairly good movie and makes for an uneven experience: passages of clever humour and great fun followed by preachy, biased, eye-roll-inducing rants. Even here the messaging is muddled, talking about equality and then advocating the opposite.Overall, it's okay but nothing more than that.\",\n",

Saw it opening night in a packed cinema all dressed in pink (yes the men too). I laughed far more than I expected and had a damn good cry. My ridiculous expectations were exceeded.Barbie is funnier and more touching than I was expecting. It's just the right kind of meta and deals with gender roles and our complicated feelings about Barbie and what she represents in a balanced and realistic way. I'm not sure how I left a film after staring at Margo Robbie and the rest and felt better about myself than before I went in. See it in the cinema if you can. Going from a loudly giggling crowd to suddenly being able to hear a pin drop when the film hit some hard truths was wonderful. Fill two hours of your time with joy and Kenergy! We are all Kenough.\",\n",
              "  'I thought Barbie would be much more childish than it was. At the beginning of the film, I thought about what I was actually watching. It started out childish, but then it turned out that it is aimed at a more adult audience. Many of the jokes in the film will not be understood by children. There were parts of the film that I liked and parts that I loathed. It is well directed and has lovely singing and dancing that sticks in one\\'s head, especially the song at the end, I\\'m Just Ken. Loved it.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling fit perfectly in their roles as Barbie and Ken and give a very good performance. The comedy and jokes didn\\'t always land with me, but at least I laughed a few times during the movie. Will Ferrell is almost always funny, which he was here. But, the whole part with the real world and all the corporate guys with their suits, felt out of place because they were just as childish as Barbieland.The film also has a deeper message, where it presents interesting arguments about how the invention of Barbie has affected the world, for better and for worse. Personally, I think that the film lost my interest a bit when there was far too much talk about \"strong women\".Barbie was better than I thought it would be, but overall it was an okay movie. Not sure I want to watch it again though. However, I will for sure keep listening to I\\'m Just Ken!This review was written by a 30 (soon 31) year old man.',\n",

This movie isn\\'t just aimed at kids in fact I would say it was definitely more for adults funny enough. Ryan stole the performance for me as Ken I looked more forward to his scenes then anything else. He captured so much in his looks and expressions that he totally steals the show and barbie actually felt secondary to me which is ironic as Ken always felt second. It could have been named Ken actually I loved knowing more about him then Barbie. Margot Robbie was beautiful and definitely captured Barbie she is stunning. Will Farrel plays the same character I feel though I love him but anyone could have played his role as boss of Mattel. I would watch it again for sure and I would actually love it if \"I\\'m just Ken\" wins best song at the Oscars and Ryan gets to sing it. Overall I can\\'t find much wrong with it my only complaint is the real world I found a little bit boring I much preferred the dreamworld. Also the Alan character was great I wish we saw more of him. I definitely highly recommend this movie it\\'s an enjoyable watch and a great pick me up smile on face movie.',\n",

Ryan was great and so was Margot but I did not understand why Barbie didn\\'t like Ken, it\\'s wildly known that Barbie loves Ken and Ken loves Barbie, it\\'s iconic and it made no sense for everything else in Barbie land to be accurate but not that. Another problem was the writing it was very \"told and not shown\" as well as wordy. The scenery was great as well as the costumes, but the story could have been so much better.

              "  \"How did I go to watch Barbie, only to have seen a mildly depressing unecessarily deep movie saturated with politics and talk of mental health. The plot made no sense.For someone who has grown up and loved watching all the classics, it was a disappointment. Most women like to watch feel-good chick flicks as an escape from reality, and for the same reason, girls like to watch Barbie. But it was nothing like that, and instead I left the cinema feeling LITERALLY depressed. As a little girl, not a single part of me thought the old Barbie movies presented a Barbie who wasn't a strong figure. And yes, you can be strong, WHILE being in love.The way the movie was filmed was truly a work of art, but the plot made NO sense despite them trying to constantly spoon-feed it to us.In Barbie land the women (the barbies) are in charge and have everything while the men (the Kens) are nobodies with absolutely no power and are treated like nobodies. They dont even have houses. When Barbie enters the real word, she realises its the complete reverse. You'd think that Barbie would then REALISE that how she was being treated is how the barbies were treating the kens, then go back to Barbie land and FIX it. Instead, when she goes back to see Ken turning Barbie-land into Ken-land (because the poor sod had a taste of what it feels like to be appreciated when he was in the real world), she has a crisis and then gathers the barbies to MANIPULATE the kens into FIGHTING each other so they can take back their power. Then instead of apologising to Ken (who was genuinely in love with her and had no TRUE bad intentions the entire movie - he thought the patriarchy was about horses) about how she constantly brushed him off like an annoying child every 5 seconds, she simply apologises for not spending some time with him, then continues to reject him and tells him he essentially needs to FIND himself. Then she wants to become human despite fighting to maintain her perfection throughout the movie, simply because someone told her its ok to be imperfect - and I get what they're trying to achieve here but I thought there would be a deeper reason? Perhaps there are things about being an imperfect human that are valuable? Such as having empathy, or maybe make it obvious that she was becoming a more realistic role model for little girls by becoming human with cellulite?I get the intention of the movie, but it really didn't have to be that deep? I REALLY just wanted to have fun at a Barbie movie. The last thing you'd want to go watch after a long day at work or school is a movie about a silly fight between men and women, politics, patriarchy, death, depression and anxiety. The beginning of the film was fun, but that fun didn't last long. But people are probably gonna call us the brainwashed barbies because we actually want men to be our equals.\",\n",

People who say it's not just don't get it. For real.The full message is round up at the very end.I laughed, I cried, it truly hit me right in the feels.The set was out of this world.

This doesn't go to say that the movie is frivolous. What happens is that it gets lost trying to explore multiple meaningful topics and never reaches the punchline. It addresses relevant themes like patriarchy, sexism, gender roles, existencialism, imperfection, individuality and identity but always on a shallow level. Every scene in this script tries to convince you that it's saying something profound when in reality it sacrifices depth and character development in favor of cheap humor, which results in an immature and non-compelling production.In contrast, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were perfectly casted and their performances are as good as the screenplay allows them to be. The production and costume design from Barbie Land are noteworthy too.Hopefully Greta Gerwig will release other movies in the future as brilliant as Lady Bird, which I genuinely think deserves 5 stars.\",\n",

The movie is also very comedic and has some really cool easter eggs about Barbie dolls and the development Barbie. The movie was very mature in my opinion and isn\\'t necessarily a kids movie even though it\\'s called \"Barbie\", a doll. It didn\\'t have too much K18 references but sexual harassment towards the main character was present so that should be taken into account when wanting to see the film with a child.Overall, absolutely beautiful movie and really touching.

Barbieland is the opposite of real world where Barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories. However, the ending just puts Barbies back on top and doesn't do much to equality which I hope is our goal. The movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up. You could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there. They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup. Good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didn't make much sense. I think this was a made for tik tok movie where there's 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together.\",\n",

              "  'Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society. Some moments were also absurd ( the fight with all the Kens). Its good anyway.',\n",
              "  \"Attending the prepremiere of the much-anticipated Barbie movie was an experience I won't soon forget, but unfortunately, not for the right reasons. At least 85% of the movie was pure hype, creating high expectations that were ultimately let down.The film seemed primarily aimed at a teenage audience, with its trendy aesthetics and themes, but it struggled to find its identity. It swung between childish and adultish elements, making it challenging to categorize and leaving viewers like me feeling a bit perplexed about its target demographic.In the first two-thirds of the movie, I managed to find a few moments to laugh, but my interest began to wane as it entered the final third. The lack of a compelling plot and engaging storytelling made it a tedious watch, and I found myself almost falling asleep in the cinema.One of the major letdowns was the extensive marketing that overshadowed the entire experience. What made the movie even more uncomfortable for me was the audience's overwhelming obsession with everything pink. Nearly 90% of the cinema-goers were dressed in various shades of pink, and it felt like an extravagant posing session rather than an immersive movie experience. It did not help that movie itself was pretty average - it heavily depends on references and superficial jokes, which can be amusing on occasion. However, after being exposed to nearly two hours of such content, I was completely brain damaged .I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a Barbie movie, but this certainly wasn't it. It fell into the same pit as some of Disney's live-action adaptations that fail to capture the essence of the original material.Despite having a few moments of laughter and initial intrigue, I wouldn't rate it more than 4 out of 10. If you're looking for a meaningful cinematic experience, this film might not be the best choice.\",\n",

For me the highlight of this movie is the opening in the world of \"Barbieland\" which is colorful and visually stunning with some campy humor and a look into the repetitive lives of these living dolls, particularly the stereotypical Barbie, played brilliantly played by Margo Robbie who is pure perfection in the role, and her hunky dimwitted boyfriend Ken, terrifically played by Ryan Gosling who earned an Oscar nomination for his scene-stealing turn, but once Barbie and Ken leave Barbieland and enter the real world the entire lighthearted tone of the film ends, it becomes a negative and turns into a weird war between men and women, I found this part of the film very boring and did not find it funny or entertaining, it turns preachy and dialogue-heavy. Gerwig\\'s direction is solid, but the most impressive thing about this film is its sensational production design which is amazing, some cute musical numbers with Barbie and Ken, and the superb cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto. The supporting performances are all good, but why America Ferrera got an Oscar nomination for her okay performance is beyond me, however special kudos must go to Rhea Perlman who delivers an wonderfully endearing performance in an extended cameo. The film is a disappointment to me that could of been way better, no masterpiece here just a good film.',\n",
              "  'It took me quite some time to decipher this movie. I felt like I was missing something, that there was more to it than first apparent. The acting, the dialogue, the sets, the costume: technically it is polished and purposeful; yet I was utterly unable to engage with it. And finally it hit me: that is because it is actually a commercial.Moreover it is nothing else than a commercial. It doesn\\'t deliver anything more than promote a product. Take the product away and there is nothing. Take away Barbie the brand, and the film is devoid of any substance. It\\'s empty. Unlike the Lego movie for instance, similarly an unapologetic ad for children\\'s toys, that managed to be a decent adventure film that celebrated the creativity that toys enable.Barbie functions as a film but only on the most superficial ways.It has a story, characters and lines of dialogue. And while some of the dialogue is clever and funny, and some of the characterization opens the door to some interesting character study, overall it is weighted down by the absolute obtuseness of the plot. The worst flaw is that it doesnt give anything of substance to do to Barbie, the protagonist. Almost every other character is moving the plot forward by either taking action or moving the story forward by emotional growth. Barbie herself is just a side character that goes from A to B and back to A. Physically, as well as emotionally. Ken has a far more interesting journey and arc. Gloria has a more important role in the story. Arguably even Sasha and Allen work better as characters with whom you relate and empathise.The worst thing is that the movie is not even a commercial for the dolls. Rather it is a commercial for the idea of the doll. I don\\'t know if we can get more post-modern than that. Barbie is not an actual doll in the movie, but she is literally the thing you think of when you describe someone as a \"Barbie\" Yet the film is very much so a commercial for Mattel\\'s Barbie and the intellectual property it represents. I think it is crass and pedestrian. The movie is purely a corporate maneuver to pivot from one business to another, from manufacturing toys to manufacturing content.That is why this film throws so much at the wall to see what sticks; that is why when Barbie leaves fake plastic Barbie-land, she escapes to fake plastic Los Angeles and nobody picks up on the irony. That\\'s why they have garbage collector Barbies in a world where there is no garbage. That\\'s why they have women Barbie doctors that aren\\'t actual doctors and when later Ken meets a real doctor in the real world, you\\'re waiting for a call-back that never happens.This movie is the absolute opposite of art. To call it a film is an insult to everything we hold sacred.',\n",

It's very hard to take such a tongue-in-cheek approach seriously, but then you could argue that it's deliberately bad, deliberately plasticky. Not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of Ferrera et al.

This movie is not only Greta Gerwig\\'s best film but also the year\\'s greatest movie so far!!!!! Margot Robbie (my favorite actress of all time) is beautiful and portrays Barbie with pure perfection!!! And then there\\'s Ken (played by Ryan Gosling in a career-best performance)!!! Robbie and Gosling shine and are easily the years best duo.The story starts with Barbie doing her usual routine in Barbieland, a land filled with multiple Barbies, each with a different occupation. The Ken\\'s also visit playing the roles a woman would play. Barbie starts experiencing real emotional symptoms like thinking about death, crying and flat feet. She learns from Weird Barbie that the Real World will have the answers to her questions. Barbie than travels with Ken to the real world and find out many things : Barbie is a doll played by a grown woman named Gloria (America Ferrera in her best movie performance), Mattel wants to put Barbie back in the box and Ken learns about America\\'s patriarchy and men rule the world. All of these problems combine into a hilarious comedy that provides great messages about woman empowerment and being who you want to be.The production design of Barbieland and costumes of all the Barbies and Kens are Oscar-worthy. The soundtrack is pretty solid with two great songs: Ryan Gosling\\'s 80s ballad called I\\'m Just Ken and Billie Ellish\\'s emotional song at the end of the movie, \"What was I made for?\".The direction of Greta Gerwig is finally put to great use in Barbie as she\\'s goes to make the best comedy in years and the script she wrote with her partner Noah Baumbach is the perfect mixture of stupid comedy, great-comedy drama and emotional drama.Gosling gives his best and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination as his role of Ken is up there with the comedy greats of Meliss Mccarthy in Bridesmaids and Robert Downey Jr. In Tropic Thunder.The real scene stealer is Margot Robbie. Robbie has been in multiple box office failures but Barbie changed that. She\\'s been nominated twice for the Oscar for her incredible performances in I, Tonya and Bombshell. My favorite actress is about to be nominated for Best Actress and Best Picture for Barbie!!!!

Again honest - I went there just for Margot Robbie (I'm a married 34 year old male, and margot is one of my top 3 favorite actrices of all time, and arguably the most talented one from my list). And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it. So if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of Margot alone, then why do her other movies don't get rated that well and get that much attention? Honestly I really don't understand and I think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason. And I have no idea why... For other movies that get hyped like that I do see the reasons why they're getting so hyped. So the movie is not awful, but it's rather average, if you're not going there specifically for Margot then I am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time you're reading this, which are way more worth watching than this one...\",\n",
              "  \"I wouldn't recommend this to any of my friends. I probably put too much expectations on this movie.It does not have any interesting stories at all. I keep watching, but the cliche just keeps going on and on. I agreed with most of the lines in the movies by the way. But still, you can definitely tell what kind of message the director is trying to convey. It's very straightforward. Nothing really surprises me.If this movie got any reward, then it would be a big shame for the movie industry. I love feminism movies, but this one is just a commercial gimmick to generate more interests from all these recent heated topics.\",\n",
              "  \"This movie represents in such a beautiful way what it is like to be a woman, and the grief we might feel growing up as one. I was so incredibly touched.Margo's acting was excellent and she is the perfect fit for Barbie.As well as Ryan. Perfect casting.I genuinely felt overflowing with love for women and felt the need to hug or hold hands with those around me.This movie did an excellent job making us women feel seen, not only as the 'girl boss' and other outdated feminist catchphrases, but also as the depth we have, and the devastating grief we feel when growing up as little girls into a world that wasn't as sympathetic as we initially thought it would be. Unfortunately it is mainly because of men and the patriarchy..\\nThe thing with these type of movies is that a woman's perspective and a man's perspective are completely different.. most women I know that watched the movie felt as I did - love, grief, touched and understood.The men that have watched the movie did love it as well (and some hated it because of toxic masculinity) but most of them weren't touched. And I think that made me a little heartbroken..\\nOther than that - it's truly is a feminist masterpiece.I will definitely will be watching again.\",\n",
              "  \"Firstly, let's start with what was good about Barbie and move forward from there. The colourful palette, the set designs and costumes were perfect to bring you into a world that doesn't take itself too seriously. Barbie wasn't meant to get all philosophical and it wasn't necessarily supposed to provide us with a point. What it gave little girls is happiness and entertainment value. In the early stages of the movie it undoubtedly had potential to be a lot of fun with a comedic effect.This silly satire soon finds itself covering too much ground about how the world of Barbie is female dominant, alongside how the real world is male dominant. It evolves into a feminist movement film that is a little dated, then slowly back peddles and suggests everyone should be who they want to be. That all you have to do is find out who you are and what your purpose is. It almost becomes lost within its own thought pattern without really conveying anything meaningful. It feels like a load of thoughts with no conclusion or that somebody has thrown a pad of post-it notes in the air. The musical tone and lighthearted comedy that seemed set to propel this movie into box office glory, felt neglected to some extent, when real world themes were contemplated. What was working at first will slowly devour with over dramatic speeches of everything that is wrong with a male dominated world. As well as other complaints about having so much on your plate and being too god damn tired.Barbie finds herself wanting to leave Barbieland to feel real emotions rather than go through day to day life like everything is perfect. The cross-over between worlds worked to some degree, to me it was showing the girl leaving behind her dolls and becoming a woman to join the sometimes scary, but real world. (Margot Robbie) portrays Barbie very simplistic, her approach works as that seems to be what Greta Gerwig aimed to show. Greta Gerwig differentiates the worlds developing both Barbie and Ken as they learn from their experience interacting with the real world. There appeared to be references to the Matrix to me as Barbie is given a choice between staying in Barbie world or going to the real world to discover what's causing her malfunctions. Also the owner Ruth Marianna Handler gives off an Oracle vibe in the scene where she offers Barbie tea. One little girl blames Barbie claiming she set women back decades making them stereotypical girly girls without a purpose except looking pretty putting clothes on and off and doing house chores.(Ryan Gosling) gives Ken a lot of charisma and is purposely obnoxious at times creating an antagonist for Barbie. The Ken's are portrayed as weak little love puppies in Barbie world without a purpose juxtaposed with how women are received in the real world. Gosling reminds me of a wrestling villain that the crowd are wanting to hate on, he is a little over the top as he is turned against his fellow Ken's by Barbie manipulation. The poor performance of Gosling attempting to cry towards the climax added to the later half of the movie losing it way. It all becomes a little too silly leaving the audience flabbergasted at what absurdity they just witnessed.\",\n",
              "  \"I realise that I am hardly the target audience of this movie, but even so, slogging trough the movie I am baffled as to what the appeal is? There must be something with all the money it made at the box office, right? I haven't read any other reviews yet so as not to spoil my own impression of the movie.I've waited for the home release and I will admit, I fell asleep a couple times and am not compelled at all to rewatch the movie any time soon.There are some visual gags and some good jokes but I felt like those kind of ran out in the first 20 minutes or so. Once you get pass the novelty of the movie, what else is there? Not much in my opinion. The only thing that could hold my interest was Ken and his subplot, but the things happening around and to Barbie I couldn't care less about. The movie didn't make me care at all about anything that happened and as such left me bored and looking at my watch. The ending scene I pretty much fast forwarded. If there was supposed to be any kind of emotional response, I detected none. Is I said, sure, I am not the target audience but the movie being so successful I expected at least something other than boredom. My only emotional response I guess is sadness, because of the inevitable copycats and sequels that will try and leech of the success of Barbie, which isn't any good in the first place.Edit: In hindsight I reviewed my rating and gave a bit more, because days later stuff like the Mojo Dojo Casa House, or I'm just Ken just stuck with me more than I like to admit so there are memorable things and as I said, the opening of the movie is indeed fun. I still think they ran out of ideas and weren't sure how to end things and as such would be weary of a sequel given that there weren't enough ideas for a single movie IMO.\",\n",
              "  \"When I first heard about this movie, I didn't want to see it. Then I watched the trailer and my mind was changed instantly. Margot Robbie as Barbie could not have been a better casting choice, Ryan Gosling as Ken was just *chef's kiss*. It's a wonderfully beautiful and talented cast. It's charming, funny, touching, powerful and overall perfect. The soundtrack is fantastic, I've been listening to I'm Just Ken on repeat for days now. The diversity and representation within the cast is beautiful and so exciting to see in a movie as big as this one. Greta Gerwig and everyone who worked on this movie absolutely knocked it out of the park.\",\n",
              "  'BARBIE (2023)\\nGreetings again from the darkness. A reasonable assumption could be made that a movie based on a doll so popular with pre-adolescent girls would be geared towards that audience. However, this is the era of comic book movies targeting \"grown-ups\", and since we know, based on her previous work (the exceptional LADY BIRD, 2017), Greta Gerwig is an intelligent filmmaker, a more reasonable assumption is that she purposefully aimed the movie at women who once played with Barbie dolls and now fill their days with work, family, and adulting. This strategy has proven to be box office gold, and the heavy dose of cosplay at screenings proves the lasting impact this plastic doll has had on many women who lined up for tickets.Ms. Gerwig co-wrote the screenplay with her real-life spouse and fellow filmmaker, Noah Baumbach (MARRIAGE STORY, 2019), and it\\'s fascinating to see what they have produced. Whether you find the film entertaining is another matter altogether, yet we tip our cap to the strange, visually-stimulating, and thought-provoking end result. Many will go in-depth on analyzing the gender politics and feminist approach to the story; however, I\\'m just here to discuss this as a movie, not a movement.Two-time Oscar nominee Margot Robbie stuns in the opening sequence (a tribute to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY) as the original 1959 Barbie. In fact, Ms. Robbie is terrific throughout in this more-challenging-than-expected role. She\\'s so much more than a pretty face in high heels, as she\\'s previously proven in a risk-taking career featuring memorable turns in such films as THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), SUICIDE SQUAD (2016), I, TONYA (2017), as Sharon Tate in ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD (2019), and last year\\'s underappreciated BABYLON (2022). This time she portrays \\'Stereotypical\\' Barbie, whose everyday is perfect in Barbieland. It\\'s here where we meet a diverse group of Barbies featuring Issa Rae, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackey, Sharon Rooney, Dua Lip, and others. We are also introduced to Ken (two-time Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling, terrific here), whose mood for the day is totally dependent on whether Barbie acknowledges him. An equally diverse group of Kens features Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, John Cena, Ncuti Gatwa, and others.Barbie\\'s paradise is rocked one day when she begins wondering about death. A trip to \"Weird Barbie\" (a kooky Kate McKinnon) lets her know that the only cure for this existential crisis is a visit to the human world, where a sad girl is playing with her doll. It\\'s really an imaginative hook to allow the two worlds to collide. Unfortunately, only bits and pieces of the human world clicked for me (loved the rollerblading at Venice Beach). It makes sense that Barbie is shocked to discover the misogyny and patriarchy ruling the human world, but there are three other elements at play here: Ken discovering that men don\\'t take a backseat to women in this world, and in fact, they dominate; the corporate office of Mattel plays like a slapstick cartoon with Will Ferrell as a nonsensical CEO; and the mother-daughter duo of America Ferrera as Gloria and Ariana Greenblat as Sasha. The big twist occurs in that latter sequence, and it\\'s Ms. Ferrera who dishes out the gut punch soliloquy about what\\'s expected of women and how they are viewed. This monologue is the lesson director Gerwig wants viewers to leave with.Barbie\\'s return to a much-changed Barbieland finds Ken and other Kens treating the Dreamhouse like a Frat house. See, the boys have learned how to run things their way ... and at its core, that\\'s my main issue with the movie\\'s theme. Empowering women is a good thing, but why did Ms. Gerwig feel the need to make everything either a win for the women or a win for the men? I have always thought equality was the goal, not dominance. It\\'s this approach that gives the film a serious and dark undertone in a quite heavy-handed manner. Sure women enjoy having power. So do men. That\\'s no great mystery solved, and in fact makes these obvious points somehow more obvious.Let\\'s talk about a few other less ominous topics. Helen Mirren delivers an admirable voiceover as the narrator, and a depressed Barbie and Ken\\'s affinity for horses are nice touches. Two of my favorite segments are Barbie\\'s first interaction in the human world ... a \"beautiful\" woman on a park bench played by Oscar winner Ann Roth (a renowned Costume Designer who did not handle the costumes for this film), and a conversation with Barbie inventor Ruth Handler (played by Rhea Perlman), who named the doll after her daughter. While I hold firm on my belief that the film is not especially entertaining/fun, I\\'ll also admit the song and dance around the \"I\\'m Just Ken\" number was a hoot. Other than performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the star here is the Production Design from six-time Oscar nominee Sarah Greenwood. The film looks amazing, even if you might get your fill of pink by the end. Barbieland is quite a sight - it\\'s a shame the rest of the movie didn\\'t deliver this much fun, and instead pitted men against women.',\n",
              "  'First of all: Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie and I also loved the quirky colorful style of the movie from start to finish. Both the pink dominated Barbieland and also the transition over to the real world are well done in my opinion.Unfortunately there isn\\'t much more to the movie than that. The story and its conclusion can be summarized in one sentence: Neither a male nor a female dominated world is good and we need to find a solution that works for both men and women. That\\'s it, that\\'s all.The story revolves around the word \"patriarchy\" with a few jokes sprinkled inbetween, none of which really worked for me. What\\'s left is the empty feeling of lost potential.The main plot element of the first few minutes, the fact that Barbie suddenly isn\\'t perfect anymore and has to deal with thoughts about death and anxiety while everyone around her keeps up the facade of perfection (that sounds interesting, right?), is almost completely ignored in favor of what I pointed out above; the same goes for the missed opportunity of seriously addressing the consumption culture that led to the creation of this \"perfect\" Barbieland in the first case. Yes, there\\'s the running gag with Will Ferrell as a CEO and a bunch of other men in suits following him around but the few jokes that result out of this create nothing more than a cynical smile at best. It will not get you to actually think about or question anything in the real world which should be the goal of any good story. If you\\'re lucky you might leave the theatre slightly amused but not with any new interesting thoughts or follow up questions on your mind.Then in its feminist territory where the movie does attempt to be critical, we mostly get these revelations about patriarchy and the oppression of women handed to us in embarrassing monologues. How can anyone enjoy this? 4/10 for the style and the acting.',\n",
              "  'Where to begin? With flamboyance of Barbie and the emotions of Greta Gerwig, this is the best release of the year so far. To address it all to mothers, specifically, and STILL touch the hearts of girls all around. To talk so, SO honestly about what it\\'s like being a girl. To say it in the first ten minutes - \"I can have feelings and use logic at the same time and it does not take away from my worth.\" to have Barbie look at her body and hate it and to make her look at an old woman and see just how beautiful her \"imperfections\" make her. To make it about growing up, but also about remaining a child. To remind girls to be both. To make the perfect example of what adolescence means to a girl. Just genius.',\n",

I encourage my children to be whatever the heck they wanna be and help them as much as I can.Now to the movie.For an afternoon showing, it was 2/3 full and mostly women and girls. Just an observation. But it was.The film is fun. It's tootles along with lots of off beat moments, a great monologue near the end (got teary there), silliness and self awareness (lots of self referential humour).My girls enjoyed it. I did too but not sure it's like 9/10 good. It's definitely enjoyable but 7/10 good.A Barbie movie could have been really bad. Really it could have been. But as has been shown by Lego movie, Detective Pickachu and few others....you can take something predominantly aimed at children and make it into something that both adults and children can engage with.The core message is great.I must say, I have heard a lot about Ryan Gosling being funny. He's ok. At least to me, he wasn't laugh out loud funny. There are much funnier things in this.But it is funny and enjoyable enough.Will Barbie dramatically change the landscape for dialogue? No, I don't think it will. It will though give pause for thought to all those who do go view it.A good, fun movie worth paying for the entertainment.\",\n",
              "  'This movie was so perfect especially as someone who has grown up with Barbie and was in pure awe of her from birth to the age of 12. I was forced to grow up due to peer pressure when I hit twelve so bye bye Barbie. I always regretted doing that because I wasn\\'t ready to say goodbye but everyone else my age was. It breaks my soul seeing young girls, younger than I was letting go of their childhood so quick, trying to keep up with the older teen trends. It breaks my soul because if I was one of those girls I would be crying for my Barbie while conforming to society. Gloria\\'s speech absolutely rocked my world. I need that tattooed in my brain, Greta is an absolute inspiration to women and girls everywhere. One thing about Barbie is I would not have an education without her. When I started school I refused to do my work unless I was promised a Barbie when I returned home, and it worked. If Barbie had not inspired women so long ago, I would probably not have completed my education as I would have found there to be no point. One thing is that I am sad or is a Barbie movie for one reason only, men will not likely see this. My brother and dad had no interest in even looking at promotion or trailers, there is no way I can get them to see this masterpiece, and they NEED to see this it is so important. If there is one movie that can change the course of history it is this one, as the introduction of Barbie did. I\\'m so proud and excited for Greta Gerwig and what is to come. As a newly out of school 18 year old my passion is to become a director or an actress, and Greta\\'s work delights me everyday because of Greta, I have a chance. Before Greta\\'s movie, I actually never heard of a female director in film, so it never even came into my head as a possibility before Greta came in. This movie has come at a perfect time for me as I turned 18 last month so this is my kickstart to womanhood, and what a way to start. I ask every woman and girl to watch this and I ask them to drag whichever man in their lives that they can. This movie is the epitome of \"yes\" there are no other words to perfectly signify this. Now, after all the mushy stuff, the humour in this film was perfect, there was never a cringy joke moment unless it was intended that way, and they never put a joke in a bad place. I was slightly worried the album may overshadow the movie, but it was perfect, never took anything away from the movie. Ryan Gosling did a fantastic job because I really believed he was Ken, nothing in me could say \"yeah that\\'s Ryan\". Margot did a superb performance of Barbie, it is hard to play a doll that is perfect yet is experiencing an existential crisis of emotion, she deserves more praise.',\n",

And it became 2023's highest grossing film too. It outdid Mario. Why? Because I think both those camps were desperate for movies that weren't simple 'hack jobs' and the hype was just THAT insurmountable.Barbie is a weird movie, but its self-awareness stops it from being a total slog through IP-promo-fodder like 'The Emoji Movie' or 'The Playmobil Movie'; it's kind of bizarre that a Barbie movie became a billion-dollar blockbuster with such a wacky story too. I guess they had to make it weird and meta to justify the film's existence at all.When will there be screenings of the movie when people dress up as the characters and rant at the screen similar to screenings for 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' or 'The Room'? That'd be a blast I'm sure.Now that this film's a thing, how long will it be before Mattel milks it out with its other franchises like He-Man and Thomas the Tank Engine (if that's strictly theirs)? My guess is they're gonna try and make those within the next 5/10 years.7/10 IMDb points.\",\n",

I just wish that there could be more Barbies for like everyday life that we go through and maybe it can get more sales. If not \"Blame Mattel\" lol.

But aren\\'t there multiple speeches about how taking care of men and fixing them isn\\'t women\\'s job?Good lord there was a point where Ryan Gosling\\'s pity-party singing just gets on my nerves and I almost wanted to turn this flick off.

This was far from that.The ending was also a bit dragged out. It was trying very hard to be profound and it wasn't working.I didn't care for any of the characters much either and was a little sad to not see Raquelle or any of Barbie's sisters apart from Skipper.Apart from the criticism, I thought the costume design was really well executed.

The film could have been much better if they had taken advantage of the potential for creative and imaginative storytelling that the Barbie franchise offers. Despite the visually appealing scenes, the overall execution left me feeling unsatisfied. I hoped for a more captivating and memorable experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of delivering that. It is good entertainment.\",\n",

However, as the film progresses and Barbie encounters her human counterparts in the real world, the thin plot becomes more noticeable. Some viewers might have preferred a subtler approach to delivering the political message, as the film can be seen as overly direct, leading to a polarizing and preachy tone. This approach aligns with the directorial style and screenplay motifs commonly associated with Greta Gerwig.The production design of Barbie Land is visually captivating, offering a feast for the eyes. The music soundtrack, featuring a standout disco track by Dua Lipa, complements the film well. Dua Lipa's cameo as Mermaid Barbie is a highlight.The film incorporates satire and self-aware humor, which adds depth to the story. However, the humor doesn't consistently land, and some moments feel forced. The character Stereotypical Ken provides sporadic moments of humor.In summary, 'Barbie' is a film worth watching at least once. It includes an empowerment monologue delivered by America Ferrera's character, addressing societal expectations placed on women. While there is still some double standard in gender role expectations, it is less prominent in today's society compared to the past. Anyway, an overhyped film from 2023 that I wouldn't watch again.\",\n",

Billie Eilish\\'s song \"What Was I Made For\" was also so good.Barbie is one of the best movies of 2023, and my fifth favorite movie of 2023 so far. I recommend going to see it in theaters.

There were just somethings that didn't need to be in this. Greta Gerwig is a great director Wonder Woman proves that it's just this movie could have been different.

In this case, I feel like the review I would have written the second the credits rolled would've been more positive than the one I'm watching now, a couple of hours later. But, as I've had time to sit with this one, I can't help but feel my opinion on it... Diminishing.Let's start on the positive though. This movie is fun. A lot of fun. It's funny, clever and it's trying to get a message across. The actors are all doing a fine job and while I might not have personally thought them to be perfectly cast, that doesn't take away from the fine job that they all did.Beyond the superficial though, I think this movie starts to suffer the more and more I dig into it. I think the pacing is just a bit off. It's either going too slow or too fast, most of the time, not necessarily to a tremendous degree, but certainly a noticeable one. Then there's the whole message of the movie, which is certainly important but is something that feels like it just came too late. I don't know that we need this particular take on sex and gender roles right now. Again, not because it's not relevant, but because other things have beat this to the finish line and frankly, done it better. This is like swinging through a McDonalds to get a Barbie pink strawberry shake after having had a delicious meal already. Sure it's fun, but it's largely pointless. It's the fluff following the real deal. That's not exactly a dealbreaker, but for a film that spends so much of its time and energy on certain things, it definitely felt diminished by the fact that its really just retreading ground already walked, albeit in a shinier package. Between that and the runaway hype train on this, all the controversy and coverage it's gotten, it's hard to not walk away from this and feeling a bit disappointed.Again, fun movie. Enjoyable movie for the most part even. It feels very much like something with superficial popularity though. Yes, it's being talked about, it's in the conversation and people are paying attention to it now but I have a very hard time imagining this having the same kind of lasting impact as other films might. And maybe that's not what it's trying to do, maybe I'm prescribing too much meaning to it, that could very well be true. But, for a movie so focused on certain things, it's hard not to draw those conclusions.\",\n",

My husband even went along and got a few laughs but ended up at the pub with my youngest because the cinema in general was too loud for her. I can see how it could upset and make people uncomfortable that are after a comedy seen through the eyes of a stereotypical comedy director, but that is what makes this movie so different. Definitely bring some tissues if you have any sort of mother-daughter relationship, both good, bad and in-between. I am so glad I could see a movie like this with my daughters.',\n",
              "  'Barbie was a very fun, light-hearted, over-the-top movie that takes you on a wild journey. The fact that it paid homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey\\'s opening sequence earned it extra points for me! Ryan Gosling was great and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast, and the production design was fantastic. A comedy movie should mainly be judged on its comedy, and Barbie for the most part is actually quite funny! I also loved how the narrator speaks over the movie at certain points and delivers some funny lines. This may get some backlash, but I feel Barbie is a movie that earns popularity because it propagates feminist ideals and speaks to the issues women face today, and audiences are willing to look past its flaws to celebrate the movie because the message it portrays is very relevant in society today. I feel the same way with Sound of Freedom. Just because a movie talks about issues you care about, however important they may be, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s the \"greatest movie of all time\" and \"Oscar-worthy\" etc. The plot of Barbie seemed quite interesting to me, how Barbie goes into the real world and the chaos that could cause. But I feel like the movie got TOO drenched in the social commentary and thus didn\\'t give the creative plot idea enough justice. Movies don\\'t have to be so explicit with the social commentary, as shown by movies like 12 Angry Men (1957), which IMO does a far better job at tackling racism and prejudice than any film made today. At certain times, Barbie really blurred the line between being anti-patriarchy and being anti-men. It felt like it was fighting injustice with more injustice, although not throughout.',\n",
              "  \"This movie made me laugh, and cry. It was a beautiful commentary on sexism and the patriarchy and how it affects little girls, while still poking fun at it all. It also spreads a really inspiring message about mothers. I personally wouldn't show this movie to a child TOO young as there are a few jokes about how barbie's don't have genitals, one bleeped f word, and a few mentions of beer. It was a LITTLE depressing, but overall very inspirational. Despite, of course, the discussion of misogyny, I laughed through the whole thing. It was hilarious. It addressed also how adult women/mothers feel self conscious about not being perfect. It was beautiful and I'd watch again.\",\n",
              "  \"This probably has been the biggest film of 2023.It was also the most shocking film of 2023 because really people didn't know what to expect.This certainly isn't the Barbie film I expected. It's not aimed at little girls, it takes massive swings at popular culture and society, and actually has a real sense of heart.Because of all these things you'll either love it or hate it. There's nobody really in the middle on this film, the reaction is so wide spread.I thought it was fine, I thought it was a nice broad comedy that we don't always have these days. Both the two leads were great, and there are lots of lovely moments.It is preachy, it does hit you over the head with its messages, but on the whole it remains bright and colourful.\",\n",

I also really enjoyed the ads threw out movie.I was really enjoying this movie but then it started getting really political, I was kind of fine with it but then they started making politics the whole story line and so it was really no longer a fun movie. After the movie finished I just ended up leaving miserable and like I waisted money... How is a family meant to enjoy this?? I can't see any 13 year old understanding anything they talk about.Also they want to talk about how being a human is hard and that were not perfect but then they hire someone to play a teen girl who has perfect hair and skin. A bit of a confusing message?\",\n",

And on so many different levels too: socio-political commentary, gender roles, off-the-wall mayhem to mention three. There are homages to classic films from the very start that had me rolling with laughter, and it never let up.In some ways I was reminded of Yellow Submarine seasoned with a strong dose of Legally Blonde.If there was anything that dragged it was the ending. So many excellent films barrel along with one plot twist or other surprise after another (Barbie certainly does) and then there's the question of how to tie up the loose ends and provide a believable ending, and in context too. Barbie just about manages it, if a bit hokey. But then there's the final scene. It's a cracker!\",\n",
              "  \"Ever since I saw Lady Bird, I knew that I will love Greta and her style. It was so human and it spoke to me. So when Barbie was released, there was no doubt I will like this film-but not this much. In 114 minutes, Greta serves everything that she intended sending a beautiful positive message about womanhood. What it means to be human, what it means to live in this broken patriarchal system. The message is clear: to be human is to feel. This movie is funny. And as someone who is not a fan of American humor, that's a big one. But I laughed through the entire movie. I also shared a tear. I loved America's monologue about womanhood. I loved Dame Helen Mirren as a narrator-great choice. Margot is a star. Her Barbie is so authentic. She portrays comedy, as well as the emotional part of the character so well. That last scene was so good. Now I can't skip the star of the film, and that is Ryan Gossling. Ken was hilarious and I will quote him for the rest of my life. But also shows that Greta is sweet to men offering them compassion by showing them that they are enough as it is, they don't have to be more than that. Greta (and Noah), really made a beautiful love letter to womanhood by showing all the parts of it-please the scene with the old lady had my heart. Overall it's already classic and the movie, that will probably be one of my comfort movies.\",\n",
              "  \"The movie starts in one direction and then changes course half way through to a rushed and unsatisfying end. The second hour of the movie is a stark contrast to the first hour. There were funny moments mixed with thoughtful gender roles, views on our patriarchal society, self-worth, etc. That took a complicated subject and made it interesting in the first half. The problem is, the movie then begins to take itself too seriously and the second half loses the clever comedy and pushes stereotypes of male and female gender roles in our society to become a rushed mess of a story that becomes preachy. There are a lot of issues in today's society with regards to gender roles, feminism, our patriarchal society, etc. The problem is the movie seems to take on some of these issues with comedy, then takes a more serious tone, and rushes through the second half so that characters brought forward in the first half have no real resolution. Sure Barbie finds her purpose at the movie's end, but it becomes a mess to get there. The rich comedy common in the first half turns to slapstick and serious drama. Are there two more opposites than slapstick and drama? The first half had me rethinking my views on how women are treated with it's lighthearted comedy, while the second half had me bothered by pushing male stereotypes into a slapstick war and a rush to finish while also being preached to about male and female gender roles. The movie seems to lose it's purpose and then rushes for a resolution. The mom and daughter story would have been better explored with a light hearted comedy that touches on gender roles and a woman's self-worth, and making it for the whole family but especially focused on an audience of young girls and women who are trying to figure out who they are. It really should have explored the mother and daughter characters and how they each struggle with being a woman in society and used Barbie as a tool of them helping to better understand each other. The movie glosses over this and despite their differences their complicated relationship is easily fixed as the focus turns back to Barbie and the focus on her. The movie brings up good ideas and a good story to once again have Hollywood ruin it. It loses focus as too many ideas, issues, characters, and plots, are brought up, to have it rushed to a finish with only some resolved. All a common problem with too many Hollywood movies these days. What is the purpose of your story? Who is it written for? Why are you writing it? Focus on that, and don't let others over complicate it. It's sad that a movie that brings up important issues especially with women's self-worth with both older and younger women is ruined by too much of everything else this movie takes on.\",\n",

Truly a great film but there are a few jokes that might go over young kids heads, as well as some of the references. One of the most fun films of the year to experience, especially if you are depressed after watching 'Oppenheimer'. It has moments of sadness, laughs and so much more.

The movie is light, with some smart things said. It was a bit too long and became little boring in the middle but after all it was fun to watch. Loved the music, costumes, choreography. Girls can relate to many things said in the movie, and I recommend you to watch it in girls company, you will have fun.\",\n",
              "  'Barbie was a very funny and cute movie, however, the movie had more fluff than substance. The plot of this movie to me seems like it was created by writing \"lego movie\" and \"barbie goes to the real world\" on a piece of paper and then just winging it from there. The movie did not flow very well and the plot line seemed almost secondary to the message that the movie was trying to preach. I say preach because the movie never actually showed any conflicts for women except for maybe one or two quick shots. Instead we got a monologue from America Ferrera\\'s character telling us the problems but never showing us any. For this reason I feel it was hard to build a connection with Barbie especially in the final act when the movie took a turn to try and be more deep than funny goofy like it had been the whole movie. There was also not very good resolution for a lot of characters. The Kens never truly got a resolution, like the writers couldn\\'t come up with a good solution. Will Farrels character seemed almost forgotten about by the half way mark of the movie. Overall it was a very funny movie, but not a very solid one. The message felt like it was preached rather than shown, the ending felt forced down the throat rather than conclusive. Also there was a ridiculous 5 minute car ad for chevrolet that made me feel like I was watching a super bowl half time commercial.',\n",
              "  \"It is funny, it is deep, it is nostalgic, it is not about romance, it is all the things the doll was meant to be.The narrator states at the beginning that the reason the doll was conceived was to give girls a path different from motherhood, but somehow we ended up turning her into this shallow stereotype to crush women's self-esteem.The movie is entertaining , it makes you laugh, has so many characters, you barely get to appreciate all of them. I don't particularly love gosling as ken, I find him too old for the role, but plays well the part.Now the important thing about the movie is the concept. The whole idea of patriarchy being the ultimate cause for the existential crisis for both men and women is just beyond brilliant. It is light enough so you don't get an existencial crisis while watching it, but you'll leave the theater with a refreshed notion that we are all suffering due to the same problem.That scene with the old lady is endearing, the scene where barbie and ken are explaining how they are feeling about being observed on the street is an eye opener, and ohh, that final joke! Bonus points for that ending!Will definitely what again.\",\n",
              "  'Who exactly was this film aimed at? Most of the audience when I saw it were adolescents, and there were numerous (perhaps too many) colourful song and dance scenes, which might have appealed to younger viewers, but also a lot of philosophical debate about gender roles and inter-relationships that would have gone over their heads, particularly as these were delivered at a frantic, garbled pace. There were some good comic scenes, and stand-out performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but as the film wore on, it all became a bit preachy. The message seemed to be about finding self-fulfilment rather than romance. Okay, not every film, or every life, has to end in a fairy-tale romantic coupling, but the emphasis on individual fulfilment within the support structure of the sisterhood seems a little bleak. It also makes nonsense of the final confusing pay-off line of the film.',\n",

When the final credits rolled the only thing that came to mind was \"So that was it?\".The Barbie Land set design is sometimes incredible and worth a star alone, but the plot and execution of the movie were a huge let down. After a promising start with a few chuckles, it becomes bogged down with negativity and cynicism trying to pass as humor in the completely messy and manic second and third acts. The obnoxious whiny dialogue really lets it down.I\\'m usually a fan of these fantasy meet reality movies based on iconic characters from popular culture and found the more child friendly Peter Rabbit, Paddington and Smurfs movies to be more mature, coherent, very funny and touching for all ages. Expectations were the same for Barbie, but none of those feelings really surfaced. I do understand on reflection that Barbie was aimed mostly at older viewers (which was probably unfair on the many cinema going younger children), however the attempts at emotion it was trying to achieve for that demographic towards the end felt far too forced, syrupy and unconvincing.Two movies which came to mind while watching Barbie that have some parallels - especially during the LA escapade scenes - were The Brady Bunch movie and Very Brady Sequel from the 1990s. These are more than 25 years older, but are funnier, do a more effective job with the \"real world\" satire and unlike Barbie are worthy of a rewatch.

It's smart, funny, clever, deep, thoughtful, etc. I was actually in tears during the America Ferrera monolog. These actors are all amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling were the perfect Barbie and Ken. The music was amazingly hilarious. The Ken battle scene cracked me up so much. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal.

Although men will watch this and enjoy it, they won't understand it or how validating it is as a woman to watch. This movie was something I hope every little girl will watch and every woman will watch so she can feel validated. This movie is so meaningful and I hope people will see behind the glitz and glamour and see the sentiment behind it. I'm so happy this movie has been created and I've never watched a film that so beautifully shows how complex it is to be a woman and how the patriarchy damages everyone in it but mostly women. It was deeper that barbie and pink and silly. It's also interesting how the dialogue is from a child's perspective of playing with a doll. It took me back to being little and playing with my dolls and thinking anything was possible and not feeling guilty about liking girly stuff, or wearing pink.

No one is asking you to be moved or to change your political or other persuasion.

Starting off in a Matriarchal society, '60s feminist paradise where every position in society is ran by women (this is never shown as oppressive or questionable) saturated with the neon pinks and pastel purples, quintessentially American and girly. All Kens are sidelined and have no meaning they are jealous of one another and simp over Barbie. Through the course of the film this paradigm is spun on its head and put back to how it was again, no fantastical change happens to this world once it is changed and fought over and won back again by the Barbies.Vapid and confused are just a few words to sum up this movie. Misandrist should be just as common as misogynist in today's vocabulary; if any film of this generation portrayed women as servile, useless, and toxic it would be slammed across the board. However in this film woman are both victorious and the victim; the oppressed and oppressor; the can-haves and the cannots. Barbie wants its pink empowered cake and wants to eat it too.I didn't expect a pro masculine message from a Barbie movie, but I also didn't expect this when asked to accompany my girlfriend. I would also never expect any woman to sit through a film that took swings and berated their gender. Is this movie harmful? Yes, a generation will be brought up to hate their fathers, brothers, and even sons. This burns bridges rather than mends them or creates new ones. It feels like a trojan horse when compared to its advertising.Many will tell you it has brains, is well written and is a fascinating commentary on society -some of that may be true. Though if truth be told it is a confused and confusing film. A feminist utopia would have women in every possible position in society, and shocked to see there were construction barbies however that no building had exterior walls or any use of windows...

It is kind of a cliche, to be honest: you have a good start, you face a problem, you can\\'t solve it at first, but with your friends help everything is figured out and ends fine. Will Ferrell whole participation, for example, is so... Strange. It seems like he is going to be an important part of the film, but suddenly he and his crew disappear and only return in the end of the movie for a, again, end cliche.Also, they try to force on, like, \"We are so deconstructed, open-heart, unmaterialistic, look how the world is sexist, look how women are underprivileged, look how Mattel is toxic\", but at the same time they are contributing for everything they are, supposedly, criticizing since they work for Hollywood and they have a contract with Mattel.Barbie was not in the news for a long time.

However, I won\\'t lie to you and say that it\\'s really all that groundbreaking as some seem to claim. While this movie focuses on heavy topics such as inequality and feminism, some of the scenes that had primarily concentrated on them had felt a little shallow. I am not saying that this wasn\\'t a great film, as said before, it delivered most if not all of the checkpoints that modern day society defines a \"good movie\" with. Now I can\\'t say that I wasn\\'t entertained mostly through the movie but it just lacked something. The longer this film had stuck with me the longer it felt insufficient. People that are currently speaking on this movie seem to pin up its success in presenting femininity and women\\'s issues in a lighthearted and joyful manner, however I feel that the overall message in this movie could have been provided in a more severe tone. The creators of Barbie stated that this was an \"everyone movie\", that this film was designed to cater to all viewers, but did it have to? The laughable tone this movie brought along with its own narrative of modern day feminism sort of cheapened the message. Don\\'t get me wrong, all the acting in the movie was phenomenal for the roles each actor portrayed, but it felt like some of the plot had gotten lost in translation. Even after watching the movie twice I still am a little fuzzy on the entirety of \"Barbieland\". Where is this really set?, why it is a common occurrence of dolls making their way into the real world?, why do barbies know they\\'re toys? I might just be inattentive but these plot point were rarely touched on through the film and still leave me confused.

              "  \"The big summer blockbuster of 2023 is a wonderful visual spectacle with a great deal of creative physical comedy, centered in and around the universe of Barbie, Mattel's historic toy doll. Unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. That a movie about Barbie would be guilty of Americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the Americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - Barbie also views everything through the eyes of Hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. Instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer Greta Gervig (Lady Bird, Little Women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly Europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.\",\n",

One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.\",\n",
              "  'Wow. I saw this movie on July 23rd and I\\'ve been thinking about it ever since. Right off the bat, the first thing that has to be mentioned is the absolutely stunning and wildly impressive set design. The backdrops, the houses, all of the set decoration in Barbieland is PERFECTION. All of the travel sequences are so fun and beautiful and creative. I would love to believe that Barbie can help usher in a new era, where we can go back to at least having some movie with real honest to god set design in a sound stage, without so much CGI. Set Dec is 10/10Next, I have to talk about Greta Gerwig\\'s clear love of cinema. From the opening sequence that starts with a perfect 2001: A Space Odyssey parody which they absolutely nailed, to a hilarious Matrix reference, and then the overarching clear love of old Hollywood and especially those old school classic musicals. The dance and musical numbers here are just an absolute BLAST!Then there is the acting. It almost feels wrong to say it, but there\\'s no denying that Ryan Gosling steals every scene he is in. His comedic timing is a triumph and the fact that we haven\\'t gotten to experience more of this in his film history is a travesty. Margot Robbie is absolute perfection, the most obvious casting for Barbie ever in the history of the world, but don\\'t let that fool you. Her balance between comedy and the emotional scenes are unmatched by anyone else here. She really is one of the best actor of this generation. The rest of the cast also absolutely kills it. America Ferrera Simu Liu, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Will Farrell, etc etc etc, everyone holds their own in this incredible ensemble performance. Acting is 10/10THE MUSIC!!!! It is so iconic and obvious and perfect that we get a full original Barbie album for this film. I\\'m not always a hard pop music kind of person, but it went so perfectly with this film, that I had to order myself a vinyl copy. But best of all, Ryan Gosling\\'s performance in \"I\\'m Just Ken.\" The dance sequence in this one is so freaking fun and good and hilarious. I can only pray that it is nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars so that we can be blessed with a live performance of this gem, can you imagine it?!? Music is 10/10And finally, the script. See how I managed to make it this far in the review without even bringing up what all of those insecure baby men on the internet seem to only be able to focus their tiny brains on? This script is hilarious, SO smart and witty, and deeply poignant and emotional. It hits home so hard on so many points while still being able to poke fun at this doll that has captivated the imagination of children for the last 64 years. I love that even though Barbie has caught some heat in the last decade or so for destroying the body image of women everywhere(I personally did not find that to be the case for me, I was perfectly happy to compare myself to all of the other fellow 10 year old girls in my age group to do that for me) we are able to also look at how the ambitions of this doll, all of her careers, the fact that there was an Astronaut Barbie before there was a woman working at NASA, etc. Then of course the dreaded wish to take down the patriarchy!! If anything in this movie seemed false or offended you, I don\\'t even know what to tell you. This felt like a very real and true example of what its like to walk through this world as a woman. So many women have shared America Ferrera\\'s monologue, and the entire set of scenes after that were some of the funniest scenes in the entire movie. And I say that as a big Matchbox Twenty fan!All in all, this movie for me is a masterpiece, it\\'s stunning, hilarious, emotional and the most fun I may ever have had in a movie theatre. Cannot recommend strongly enough! Easily my favourite movie of 2023, can\\'t imagine how anything else could come close.',\n",
              "  \"Barbie is agonizingly close to being a masterpiece. Imagine your run of the mill 2020s high budget film. Now let's go through it with a fine comb and add a bunch of brilliant tiny details to the first two acts, but then let's have a third act that fits the modern trend of overstaying its welcome and failing to provide satisfactory answers to its own questions and lacks all those fun little bits that made you love the first two thirds of the movie.Without spoiling plot, Barbie much like Game of Thrones and Hunger Games hints at complex understanding of social and political issues but ultimately settles on the safest most vanilla possible answers to those problems. It also, in modern fashion, wastes time going off on tangents.I feel, much like Margot Robbie, pulled in two directions. A part of me wants to praise the film for shedding on light on feminist issues while another wishes to tear it to shreds for copping out in the end.The further one gets into Barbie, the less its complexities feel like they are there to make a point, and the more it feels they are there to fill time.If you're like me you'll leave in a disappointed but forgiving mood. Even if the ending fumbles what was set up, I can't forget my enjoyment of the setting up itself.\",\n",
              "  \"I was not expecting this movie to be great; I'm not into this kind of stuff, but still, I watched it, and man, it was great; some scenes are relatable to how people react to something nowadays, like, come on, everything and everyone can be cancelled, the overall acting of the cast is super great. I love it; almost all the song are catchy and complements the movie (like this song, by the way (Im just Ken)); the production set for this film is majestic, and parts of the movie are touching and somewhat relatable to our everyday life, and there can be something to learn from, very recommended to watch this with your whole family and friends.\",\n",
              "  \"There's so much to say about the movie, so many points to touch on that I don't know how to express it correctly.Let me start by discussing a few parts that I really liked. First of all, Ryan Gosling's performance was amazing; it overshadowed everything in the film. A masterful and remarkable performance. While not Margot Robbie's best performance, she did quite well too. I didn't find the other actors or actresses quite as impressive.Another aspect I found impressive was the costumes; in my opinion, the film definitely deserved an Oscar for them. They were the best costumes I've seen in a long time. Similarly, the color coordination was superb.I also enjoyed the production; most things were cohesive from a technical standpoint. The comedy in the film was of good quality, and there were scenes that I really enjoyed and had a lot of fun watching.Now, moving on to the things I didn't like, and the area I'd like to emphasize the most - the screenplay. After watching a strong first half, I became very invested in the movie, but the ending suffocated me. Trying to convey so many messages felt utterly pointless. The film had already managed to balance comedy and drama in the first half; there was no need to forcefully shove these messages down our throats in such a contrived manner. I understood the message, but I ended up leaving the theater feeling frustrated.In addition, there's a part I absolutely disliked: Barbie's convincing Kens with their beauty and then reclaiming Barbie Land. It felt too simplistic and contradicted the main point of the movie. It definitely could have been written more cleverly. Moreover, the metaphorical scene of Classic Barbie talking to the creator (metaphorically) and visiting a gynecologist was harsh and not smartly executed. It was emotional, yes, but personally, it felt heavy.In short, summing up the technical aspects and acting, the film scored a 6.5 to 7 from me. However, the disjointedness of the screenplay and its excessive urge to convey messages left me extremely disappointed. Women are our treasures; we should stand firm against discrimination and support each other. Let's love one another, let's love our women - they are our mothers. They are all invaluable, and so are we. Hopefully, one day everyone will be equal, just like Barbie's aim, and you can achieve your goals just like Ken does.Note: Regardless of everything, people should stop comparing Barbie and Oppenheimer ; Barbie ran a crazy advertising campaign, and it's necessary to admit that their popularity and the pink frenzy are owed to their advertising efforts.\",\n",
              "  'I am not surprised in the least that the Barbie movie is trash and a truly deplorable career choice by Margot Robbie who will probably be type cast forever in Barbie-type roles.To begin with, there is just too much pink and superficiality for this movie to inspire anything more than groans and watching your watch waiting for the whole travesty to be over. The plot is completely by the numbers as Barbie has the perfect life in Barbie World. Then suddenly she yearns to see the \"real world.\" Where did we see that storyline before? Let\\'s see... I know... The Little Mermaid and a hundred other movies ripping off the same plot.But if that\\'s not bad enough, we have to sit through dreary dialogue such as Ken wanting to sleep over with Barbie while being totally innocent of sex and the fairy god mother pressuring Barbie to reject the high heels in order to seek enlightenment, as if Barbie should not make the choice on her own without somebody prodding her in a particular direction.Even the people who like it can\\'t point to anything original in it. Where that 77% comes from is beyond me.',\n",
              "  \"Every one - man and woman, should watch this movie with an open-mind and introspection about current society. Barbie was one of the most real, complex, insightful, trippiest, thoughtful, and educational videos I've watched in a long time. This movie is not for everyone and is definitely not designed for kids due to the much deeper meaning. To get the full experience of the art of the movie, you have to ready to focus and peel all the symbolic layers.I came in expecting a lighthearted, fun, and silly movie like how you expect the stereotypical Barbie brand. But the movie brought so much more depth and substance. Be ready for a rollercoaster of emotions!\",\n",
              "  'This is a very attractive film. The first half is quite stunning and good, but it falls apart in the second half burdened by political correctness and social preaching. It simply becomes a self-serving bore. And what is it with all the award nominations ? No doubt the ones for production design and costumes are justified. Ryan Gosling and America Ferrara are good, but Oscar nominations, really ?The Academy overlooked some terrific supporting performances in 2023 that far surpassed\\nGosling and Ferrara (for example, Rachel McAdams or Kathy Bates in \"Are You There God? It\\'s Me Margaret\" or Dominic Sessa in \"The Holdovers\"). And what\\'s with the nomination of \"I\\'m Just Ken\" for Best Song ? Really ? Will anyone be singing it 10 years from now - or even 2 ?The only Oscar nomination for acting that this film deserved was Margot Robbie for her performance as Barbie, and the Academy ignored it. Such a shame, because she was spot on and carried this film from beginning to end with sincerity, emotion, and spirit. Robbie understood her character, as written, and played it to perfection. Mention should also be made that her scenes with Rhea Perlman, as Ruth, the creator of Barbie, were outstanding. Perlman is excellent and demonstrates just how good she can be when she is given a role that taps her wonderful talents. Finally, the ending is just ridiculous and unbelievable - leaving it wide open for a sequel, but, see if you really care to sit through another Barbie movie by these writers.',\n",
              "  'Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig, director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way - although, in this case, it is almost inevitable to fall into some clich√©s. The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won\\'t be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.In the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the Barbie Universe, the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations, very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project. In these changes of atmosphere, we were able to appreciate the creative photography by Rodrigo Prieto - who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit - and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration, between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices, such as costume pieces, type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001: A Space Odyssey. Here, we\\'ll catch glimpses of \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"The Truman Show\"; we\\'ll go through the fairytale-like artificiality of Jacques Demy\\'s films; for the dance and choreographic performance of Gene Kelly; for the visual and dramatic intensity of The Little Red Shoes and All That Jazz... it\\'s a lot. \"Barbie\" is a well of enriching cinematographic references.But, leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look, in addition to addressing important points of today\\'s society, Greta Gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms \"Barbie\" into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism. The production is very much in line with a famous Quentin Tarantino interview in 2021 given to Bill Maher on his HBO broadcast \"Real Time\" in which he said: \"Ultimately, ideology trumps art, individual effort, good, entertainment\". Unfortunately, in this film, this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy, full of language, allegories, open messages and ideological discourses. The film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone, to be a comedy and romance epic, and it had the quality to do so, but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced, trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrol.The film has an interesting premise, that\\'s undeniable, and it flows most of the time, but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn. Since the target audience here is females of all ages, this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained, but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists: an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy; criticism of beauty standards; the hypocritical discourse against consumerism (as if Warner, Mattel, artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales, from selling new dolls, etc.); man-hatred (all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idi*ts, gr*edy, d*mb, or wanting power for themselves). Greta Gerwig\\'s goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard, because the \"Stereotyped\" Barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act, mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy - the character Sasha, played by Ariana Greenblatt, is the one who plays this role, like the militant of today, always connected and who knows everything about life (where Gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentions).The truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate, not love. Barbie, here, hates men, capitalism, fun and hates Barbie doll herself (calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot). Barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll, if you\\'re a woman and you played with her as a kid, according to the movie, you supported patriarchy. Barbie can\\'t just be a pretty, blonde, thin woman either, after all, that doesn\\'t encompass the mandatory \"diversity and inclusion\" in Hollywood today. To resolve this issue, they created a universe in which everyone is Barbie (we even have a Barbie who was born a man, yes, a trans Barbie - who, by the way, is a doctor). The men in Barbieland (who cares) are there to be mistreated and ignored. Ken is just an accessory. When Barbie and Ken come into the real world, everything changes. Ken discovers patriarchy (a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot) and likes that world. Barbie finds unbridled machismo (if Barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense). Romance between Barbie and Ken? Not at all, after all that wouldn\\'t be \"empowering\" at all. Ken even rejects the doll at one point.Ken represents the \"evil patriarchy\". Everything in this film becomes one big lecture, one big sermon (Barbie scolding workers who whistle at her; police officers harassing Barbie at the police station; a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue), that is, victim of the \"toxic\" men of the world. Barbie still has to choose between flip-flops and heels, showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made: follow feminism, that is, flip-flops. We also have the passage of the protagonist Gloria cheating on her husband (a fool, by the way), and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheating.All male clich√©s are portrayed here according to the feminist view (because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time, according to the film\\'s script). Here, the Barbies were co-opted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the Kens in a kind of macho dystopia. Everything Ken likes is depicted as toxic, evil, and terrible (Stallone, Godfather, horses, Zack Snyder, etc.). Barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women (women have everything, men have nothing); Mattel executives are all portrayed as white, straight men and still calls this type of profile \"conservative fascist\". For the director, it is never enough to be a woman, you have to be a mother, a wife, work and still receive criticism. The unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies, and that they cannot study, work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work (Yes, because apparently the \"evil businessmen\" hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job!!). At the end of the plot, Gloria\\'s feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy. Kens are beaten because they are \"d*mb\". The Barbies plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective Ken jealous with another Ken, of course, after all, all men only know how to create wars, destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid (After all, if men are stupid, why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film? A basic and inexplicable plot hole here).\"Barbie\" is a great satire, but when it touches on feminist issues, it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men, since women are portrayed as being totally perfect. Sasha and Gloria are the main Latin characters here and the Barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas. Obviously, the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and, of course, the popularity of the Barbie doll that has been successful for generations, in addition to having many merits, especially in the technical part. The detailed, creative and extremely tasteful scenarios, especially in Barbieland, are a spectacle in themselves, in addition to the magnificent performances by Margot Robbie (charismatic and incredibly beautiful) and Ryan Gosling (hilarious as ever). The musicals, on the other hand, are horrible, poorly performed and owing a lot in that regard.\"Barbie\" talks about choices and changes. In the hands of Greta Gerwig, the typical behavior of dolls and dolls, via imagination, takes on a critical form and points to many paths, visiting metalanguage, political-social relations, patriarchy and feminism, feelings (including the arrogant and insensitive posture of Barbie in front of Ken; as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend), existential crises or acceptance of one\\'s social and gender condition. The work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a live-action Barbie, that is undeniable. The problem is that, in the end, Barbie doesn\\'t even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of self-discovery. \"Who is Barbie?\"',\n",

Barbie is funny and surprisingly entertaining. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach wrote an enchanting script with genuine emotion. Barbie was brilliantly cast. I loved Ryan Gosling.

I can't deny that Margot Robbie was an exceptional Barbie but overall I was disappointed with the film. Gerwig went a bit too far with her support of women's rights (which I do support).

Instead, I was greeted with an overly dramatic, some would say cringey, movie that sounds badly written. It seems that this movie doesn't fit in any category. It is definitely not a drama, nor a comedy as all the jokes were laughable, but for the wrong reason. The moral of the story is one that can definitely be appreciated, but just isn't suited for this type of movie.

I should also say that I think the emotional moments were written very well too, particularly Barbie and Ken's 'breakup' at the end, which I thought was the best scene in the film 3) The production design and costume design were both terrific and will probably win their respective OscarsNEGATIVES:1) There are multiple times where the film was far too goofy for me. Examples include the chase scene in the Mattel headquarters and the car chase scene that follows it 2) The message, whilst respectable in a way, was just far too on the nose for me at times. When it was done subtly it felt clever and interesting, but then when they just did big monologues at the end it just became too over the top 3) The film felt quite dated for me. If this had came out in the 90s or 2000s I feel like it would've been much more impactful and relevant, whereas nowadays not many kids play with Barbie dolls and the male-dominated society is nowhere near as prevalent.\",\n",

It's extremely campy throughout, but also recognizes that life is very much complicated. It's not easy being an adult woman or man. Do you want to laugh? Watch this movie.

However since in the end they practically does not do anything then you are left with the question, do we really need to see the Mattel executives in here?It certainly feel like the script has been rewritten a few times thus the message becomes quite complicated, convoluted and confusing for general folks like me.

The development was very deep and relates to the audience very well. The dialogue was great, too, as there was just enough of it, showing depth. Ties into the plot and theme thoroughly.Barbie has impacted girls for many years and the movie introduces the audience to a light hearted history of it.

But the world of Barbie the audience sees is far from perfect, and it is separated from the real world of those who actually play with her. The plot development was amazing, as Barbie goes on a mission to discover herself and save her Barbie world. In the meantime like the slogan says, \"She\\'s everything. He\\'s just Ken.\" Ken is also having a crisis in being number two, and questions how he fits into the Barbie world. As both toys deal with their identity crises, the themes of empowerment, patriarchy, feminism, and being yourself comes into play. Other valuable life lessons are shown as well that makes this movie memorable for women and even men. The themes are powerful and heartwarming, yet raw and honest. The sound was bubbly and popping, the graphics impressed me the most. From the costumes, to the plasticity of objects, to the action everything was visually effective. The camera angles were also notable.This movie was very upbeat and much more hilarious than I orginally anticipated. The movie resonates with what its like as they tackle the real world. The movie brings so many elements from various generations of Barbie and the audience learns about the creator and what it means to be-Barbie. As she and Ken both question their existence, the heart of the movie centers on the impact that they make towards themselves and others. With fantastic graphics, dancing and song, humor, and life lessons this movie makes it a captivating film that everyone will surely enjoy!',\n",
              "  'I had no idea what to expect going into Barbie. I had no interest in seeing a movie about Barbie but was immediately sold on the highly talented Margot Robbie and the awesome Ryan Gosling. But I was still nervous that the comedy would be aimed strictly at women and would be difficult for a guy to enjoy.To my surprise, I didn\\'t feel that at all. This movie is hilarious. It\\'s the kind of stupid-funny I love, the kind usually reserved for \"dude movies.\" Something you\\'re more likely to see in a Will Ferrell movie. I was not aware Ryan Gosling could be so funny.Even though the majority of the movie is silly and fun, Margot Robbie still gives a great performance, as usual. She continues to prove she\\'s a star. And most of the supporting cast are welcomed additions.I found Barbie highly entertaining. I think most will enjoy it, except maybe guys who are sensitive to anything empowering women or making fun of men. That\\'s not me. The parts that made me laugh the most are the jokes about the guys.(2 viewings, early fan screening UltraScreen 7/19/2023, 3/24/2024)',\n",
              "  \"When it was announced that Barbie was to be made as a live action movie I cringed and pretty much forget about it. Then the hype erupted, and you couldn't get away from the frenzy surrounding this movie. I had to see the trailer; my intrigue got the better of me.Wow! It actually looked good! Parody, satire, an interesting premise.Now, I wasn't prepared to just take the plunge, I still had my doubts and didn't want to be paying Cinema or home premier prices. So, I waited, but remained strangely eager to enjoy this guilty pleasure and hopefully have a great laugh in the process. After all, the reviews and buzz around Barbie never seemed to die down too much.¬£1.99 on Prime was the clincher. I am a middle-aged man, and I persuaded my wife and teenage son to watch it with me. The Trailer sold it to them easily.Instant smiles when kids began smashing their dolls, mimicking the apes in 2001: A Space Odyssey.The next 15 minutes was sickly but set the scene and bridged to the premise teased so much in the trailers.The next hour was ok, but never really reached my expectations. It had some humorous moments, little else.The final 30 minutes was just awful! Terrible songs and relentless bashing over the head with their big message. It was insulting how the movie makers forced this down the viewers throats as if we were all completely dumb and wouldn't understand it if it wasn't repeated over and over again!It wasn't the message that ruined the movie, the message is valid and strong, I couldn't agree with it more! Sadly, the movie is largely boring and dull. This formula framed in a sickly Barbie world as it is, just doesn't convey the message well at all.Great ad campaign, and obviously the movie is appealing to some, just not to me or my family.A generous 3/10\\nMy wife gave it 0/10My advice if you feel the urge to watch, as I did. Give it 30 minutes. If you aren't seeing what you came for by then, it isn't for you.\",\n",

I don\\'t think is \"too preachy\" as other comments say. Is an important message that needs to be tackled more to have a more fair society maybe one day. Even ignoring the message, it had a good comedic approach to not just be depressed by the reality it shows, had great music, good acting, creativity, good visuals, all in all great movie. I like that it didn\\'t have a typical love story ending, which would have ruined the whole point of the movie. A fresh movie that is needed.',\n",

At one point Barbie is asked where do the Kens sleep and she thinks for a moment before saying \"I don\\'t know\" then that\\'s it we never learn, basically her saying \"I don\\'t know and I don\\'t care.\" They did so well showing Ken\\'s feelings of being inadequate, inferior and almost like a toy for Barbie to play with when she wanted and yet they just end with the Barbies taking back control of Barbieland, they give Ken\\'s low level government jobs because they should struggle like woman. So, the message is it\\'s okay for one gender to have to fight, claw and struggle for anything good as long as it\\'s men?Also this is entire my own preference and has no fault of story but most of the cast was a bit rubbish for me anyway. It was as if the casting director watched some British shows and picked actors from, like did we really need 3 sex education actors all of which were pretty bland?',\n",

There is a lot of satire in the film, that I feel some will take to be truths.But, costumes and sets were on point! I hope that team gets all the nods for their accomplishments. The soundtrack is lacking, too. Maybe I do not have many nice things about this film, other than it wasn't for me. Instead of it being a cute comedy, I became more depressed by watching the movie! Margot and Gosling played their roles well, and I applaud them. But the other all content, was just too deep, and not fun.\",\n",

Well I am happy to say that I am wrong because I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end! Margot Robbie was great as Barbie while Ryan Gosling was great as Ken! It also stars America Ferreira, Will Farrell and other A-List actors! It definitely has a great story line to it and the soundtrack was also amazing!

Several of the cameos were also great.Had fun, but wouldn't really recommend it as a 'must watch'. Mostly watched it as the first part of the Barbenheimer meme, so it was worth it for that reason at least.7/10.\",\n",

America Ferrera is giving a bombing acting like she always does! Margot Robbie is just wauw, she is made for this role, i'm so glad she got the role and not Amy Schumer as previously requested. I would die to see the movie again for the first time, for now I will just wait for it to come on streaming and will stream it again! We are Kenough.\",\n",
              "  \"For me, Barbie came very, very close to an 8/10 rating. The only reason it didn't quite get there was that it contains a few scenes that are too long and a bit too weak.On the plus side, there are several more things to mention. First and foremost, Barbie has attracted a very strong cast, with well respected names also in several supporting roles, and they all perform well. Margot Robbie was almost an obvious casting choice. With her skills and her appearance, she really IS Barbie (with a brain) for almost two hours.Director Greta Gerwig and her crew created perfect Barbieland sets, which made me smile in spite of the fact that I never owned a Barbie doll myself.The film had me laughing many times, and it also brought me to tears a few times. Quite impressive for a movie about a doll, I thought.And, last but not least, the message of the movie. Already when I heard that Greta Gerwig was going to make a Barbie movie, I knew we were in for a culture clash. The fact that she went all-in was not surprising to me, but that she managed to convince Mattel to go along with her was. Kudos not only to Greta Gerwig for that, but also to Mattel. This may turn out to prove enormously profitable for them in the end, and they undoubtedly hope to make Barbie relevant for a few more generations. Nevertheless, this took guts on their part. Well played.\",\n",

I really felt the joy and energy that everyone put in to make this possible. Margot makes a perfect Barbie, but Ryan's Ken is just perfection. I really hope they will get showered with awards and recognition!The attention to detail is stunning. The movie often shows such iconic elements that kids that played with Barbies immediately recognize. In my opinion they did a great job on balancing the fact that they are dolls, but they are still played by real people.Some points of critique: at times the pace felt rushed, for my mother depending on subtitles combined with the visual pace, it was not always easy for her to follow. I was expecting a lot more fashion from Barbie, it seemed that Ken was more in focus on serving the looks. Some musical numbers dragged a bit too long.But still I give it a 10!\",\n",

She is joined by Ken ( Ryan Gosling) in this fantasy of pink decor, colourful costumes and the kitsch sets in a dream like atmosphere . The movie has exquisite cinematography ,melodious songs and attractive dances. There is an innocent quirkiness in the characters and the intermittent light humour keeps one amused. There is fun and fantasy all the way in all colourful scenes. The rainbows in the background add to the beauty. The cinematography has carefully framed fabulous visuals which will appeal to all audiences. The highlight of course is the superb acting of Margot Robbie who excells in exuding the innocent charm of the much loved character. She is definitely a refined artist who gets under the skin of the character. Ryan Gosling also does well as Ken showing his versatility. His one liners are said with his typical charm which will please his fans. The special effects help to create the dream like ambience and are pleasing to watch. I forsee the movie getting nominated for best actress ( Margot Robbie ) and for production design, costume design , make up and cinematography.',\n",

I thought it would be some fun movie just to chill while you're watching it. But this movie is a lot more than just fun. With this movie we can see ourselves in it. It shows how powerful women are. But also how hard it is to be a woman. And not just that. Also our childhood. The barbieland is our childhood. Peaceful, enjoying life. But when it's our time to leave it, it's scary and new because that's the adult life. The finale scene shows us that to live is the most beautiful thing we can experience. And some people are stereotypical barbies who don't know how to live their life in the most human way. We are here to smile, cry and improve ourselves. But sometimes we get lost and need to find ourselves again. It's a cycle that we need to go through. This movie represents a lot of things not just one. And I think everyone who watches that film can find a different meaning.\",\n",
              "  'Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. Its good anyway.',\n",

              "  \"Let's face it: this film is not supposed to be good. It certainly isn't supposed to offer much more than eye-candy and a few songs. Yet, 'Barbie' in its own way has come to house all the pieces we look for in a movie. For her first live-action story, Greta Gerwig managed to craft an experience that captures everything right, and everything wrong with what the doll has represented to generations of girls. Set design was a dream and at opening feels like the first time we saw Dorothy step into Oz. The cast carried a full load of heavy-hitters and Gosling's Ken made a few attempts to steal the show. Margot Robbie is the true star that shines as she gives much more attention, depth, and charisma than Barbie had any right to be - creating a 3D character that is both whimsical and disturbingly real. Although it is an entirely different think-piece to discuss gender roles, the fact remains that any authentic Barbie story cannot be told without it. Gerwig's real genius is that she is able to tell the story within the story without it feeling like a finger-wag. The fact is, the pacing and humor is more than enough for viewers to see themselves on both sides of the fence. Cunning, sharp, heartfelt, and hilarious, 'Barbie' is an open love letter to past, present, and future mothers and the ties that bind through the obligation of perfection. In the end - like its namesake - the film represents whatever you want it to be. After all, isn't that what she was made for?\",\n",

They wanted to make a political movie about what women could be if we took down the patriarchy and the men can just be who they want to be with feelings and all.The execution is colorful and you feel the sarcasm in every choice the movie maker made.I would have given it a lower score but I gotta admire the research and execution.It seems I must have missed a lot of jokes because some people were laughing when I was not.What's up with having so many cast members of Sex Education?Also?! Was that Gosling singing?! He gotta sing more! However, why him as Ken? Don't get me wrong, I love the guy but he didn't really fit as sand blond Ken.\",\n",

I interpreted the overall point of the movie to be that today's feminism has gone a little overboard and has put way too much pressure on women to feel like we have to be the career driven, leader boss b*itch to have a meaningful life. This movie voices that sometimes women (while respecting the women that do) don't want to be a leader, who's a mom and has the career. Sometimes we just want to be average and that's ok. I also felt the mother and daughter scenes in the movie tug at my heart and GG did a great job and adding those pieces throughout the movie. While I agree that it was annoying how the Kens were treated at the beginning of the movie, I felt the ending tied it all together. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. As humans I think we sometimes find ourselves wondering what was I made for? And even though this was referring to Barbie, it can be very relatable.\",\n",

This movie became one of the most different and crazy events of our day. I don't think it has any value as a movie. It was indeed a bad movie, but as an event it was fun. I don't regret. There were some references. I liked most of them. The acting wasn't bad, I think it was good. I was getting bored again near the end of the movie.

The humour was lame, I thought that the performances were weak (am I the only person who isn't a Margot Robbie fan?), and the songs were beyond awful.About the only thing that I can commend about the film is its production design, but even that got on my nerves from time to time (the travelling to the real world from Barbieland on cardboard cut-outs -- sheesh!). Obviously, I'm in the minority for not liking this film, because it has a high rating and has made a mint at the box office, but I guess we can't all like the same things.\",\n",

But I would love it if I gad some movie like this to watch during my teenage days.Direction was impeccable, cast amazingly well chosen, scenography immaculate, as well as makeup and costume. Storytelling was absolutely superb.Serious issues were told in a very innovative manner and philosophically it is highly important film because of all the antagonisms. It doesn't offer a solution, and with an excellent reason - the answers are in each of us.Absolutely brilliant work and I would watch it again many times. (In contrast to Oppenheimer which was biggest bore of all the time)This comes from a person who never liked playing with Barbie(s).\",\n",
              "  'On the plus side, this was an ambitious, dazzling film with what I felt was an original concept. It explored the world of gender stereotyping and male-female relationships, using the world of Barbie and Ken as its base point. There was a strong feminist theme running through it, but I did not find this overwhelming. Whilst the male figures were often portrayed as stupid and one-dimensional, this was done with some wit and indeed affection.The action migrated between the real world and the mythical world of Barbie, and so perhaps it was no surprise that the plot tended to meander and remained unconvincing. The energy of the film was sustained by the comedy and the zaniness of the characters.I differ from some critics in that I thought the best performance came from Margot Robbie as Barbie. Her character bounced between parody and realism but she managed the demands well. I thought that the much acclaimed Ryan Gosling tended to over-act and his character became annoying.This may be down to my age and my Englishness, but I was unable to make out the detail of the many snappy one-liners that were delivered. The young and the American will probably not have this trouble.Though likeable and even moving in places, altogether this film felt like less than the sum of its parts. Its attempts at juggling comedy and serious themes, fantasy and reality, were not ultimately successful and it became incoherent and lacking in some kind of unity.Ultimately, for me, the acid test of a film is the issue of whether or when I start wanting it to end. I made it to about two-thirds of the way through.',\n",
              "  'So at the time of the release, I chose Oppenheimer over Barbie and I can\\'t express how grateful I feel towards that decision. I know I\\'m late but I saw Barbie on OTT last night and believe you me, it was a torture! I mean, I sat through everything that Greta tried to sell but I just couldn\\'t buy the entire thing. There are a couple of things which didn\\'t make sense to me. I mean, the whole time, the movie was trying to make a point that patriarchy isn\\'t good and it\\'ll destroy all good things. At one point, Ryan Gosling\\'s Ken is shown venting out his inner thoughts how he has always been kept in the shadows and taken for granted. I understand that Margot Robbie\\'s Barbie didn\\'t feel for him the same way, but then why enjoy the privileges and the attention? Also, when I finally saw her apologizing for her behavior, I thought that the story is going towards making a point that\\'s equal. I thought equality is the end of the movie. But alas, it restored matriarchy in \"Barbieland\". I mean, how is common sense not so common these days? If you put moore weight on any one side of the weighing scale, YOU WILL LOSE BALANCE! It doesn\\'t matter whether it\\'s patriarchy or matriarchy! Towards the climax, the Barbies plan to turn the Kens onto each other in order to take back the power and governance of \"Barbieland\". And they do this by the means of MANIPULATION! So even if they\\'re dolls and not real women, the only convenient way to get the job is manipulation! I know that someone can argue that the Kens deserved it because they did the same thing to the Barbies when they took over \"Barbieland\". And you\\'re right only if you agree that neither Barbie nor Ken is perfect. If that was Ken\\'s way, it was Barbie\\'s too. One more scene that set me off was how, in the end, the Kens ask the president Barbie for a chair at the constituency and she says no. Before she said no, in my mind, I thought, \"Yes! This is the moment the Barbies show they\\'re empathetic and different. The message of this movie would be equality!\" I was a fool to expect this from a movie that promoted matriarchy. Ken is brainwashed into thinking that he is \"Kenough\" and can has to find his own identity. While the Barbies will once again rule \"Barbieland\". I know there won\\'t ever exist equality in this world. But I also know that there won\\'t exist a \"Barbieland\" in reality too. In a nutshell, all this movie is, is Greta\\'s delusional solution against men. The 4 stars I considered giving are only for the performances of Margot and Ryan. The movie is seriously lame!',\n",

Greta Gerwig managed to make our wildest Barbie-dreams come true and not only created some of the funniest comedy i've seen in a long time in a movie, but also made me agree so hard with every feminist message she put in the film. Messages that everyone needs to hear - even, or should i say, especially men.The performances where wonderful, particularly that of Ryan Gosling who really tapped into his Kenergy. I thought it was interesting to see that not only Barbie aka Margo Robbie got a character arc, where she got to grow up to become a woman. Also Ken aka Ryan Gosling underwent some significant character growth that I much appreciated.As the trailer said; If you love Barbie, you will love this film. If you hate Barbie, you will still love this film. Because it isn't only about a doll, but also about the patriarchal system we all have to deal with on a daily basis and about the complexity that is human life in general.

First girls movie I love with no overt emphasis on a romantic relationship. Just a beautiful, complex, funny story about barbie. Everyone was perfectly casted. I was nervous about all the young children in the audience but there was no sexual scenes, little cursing, and most innuendo seemed to go over their heads. Loved the light this movie shed.',\n",
              "  'This was an interesting film. Nothing about it was normal. It takes an iconic toy brand and makes a serious social commentary/coming of age story out of it. It was also a smash hit financially, backed by a strong social media campaign linking it with a movie about nuclear bombs. That\\'s impossible to repeat.From a technical standpoint, it\\'s amazing. The casting was perfect. Margot Robbie is the perfect \"stereotypical Barbie.\" This is a Barbie that is both the perfect doll she is known as, and also the maturing Barbie who\\'s seeking a purpose and to right her world. They could not have picked a better leading actress. Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken. Even the characters created for this movie were perfectly cast, especially Will Farrell as the CEO of Mattel (it\\'s my personal headcanon that he and President Business from the Lego Movie are the same person, also it\\'s amazing Mattel was okay with this script). Note for anyone who didn\\'t have Barbie in their childhoods: there is Barbie lore, and the movie does assume you know who the characters are.You will never see a movie that looks like this again. Barbie enters a rare selection of movies that are instantly recognizable from a single screenshot. Barbieland looks exactly like a world made of Barbie dream houses. The bright pastel colors, the overload of pink, the way everything is shaped makes it a real life town of dollhouses, and it\\'s highly impressive. It\\'s made with such a real love for its source seldom seen in movies. Additionally, part of what makes the casting so good is the ability to make the actors look like dolls. The soundtrack perfectly befits the film. The two dance numbers (one for the Barbies, one for the Kens) are very well choreographed. Perhaps most importantly for fans and enthusiasts, there are several wardrobes worth of costumes for all the Barbies, based on different outfits she\\'s worn over the years.This is, as one would expect from Gerwig, also a film carrying strong feminist messaging. Some people were surprised by that upon release, although being surprised by a Greta Gerwig movie having feminist messaging is like being surprised that a Tarantino movie is violent. This is where things get complicated. On one hand, the messages appear to hit the audience with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, which some may deem necessary given the urgency of its subject matter. On the other hand, it\\'s so over the top it\\'s difficult to tell how seriously you\\'re supposed to be taking it. It often feels like a satire of itself. There are times when it feels like a Mel Brooks movie. This is a problem because it muddies the message. You could very well watch this movie and come to the conclusion that it\\'s supposed to be a satirical takedown of feminism, which is the last thing the filmmakers want you to do. And when it does spell it out, it can very easily come off as preachy. This is quite a conundrum, and highly ironic. I\\'m really not sure how a filmmaker would make this work.Now, despite all exterior appearances, Barbie is a very nuanced film that has several layers to it, and does not provide all of the answers, nor does it need to. Now, while it is ultimately a feminist film, it does not shy away from addressing some things the movement is doing wrong and has done wrong in the past. No matter how it may look or seem on the outside, there\\'s a whole world of ideas in its subtext. This is where the strength of its messages lies, not in the bluntness of its outer appearance. It does have some comic relief, which is mostly meta humor. Not my cup of tea, but if you like it then enjoy it. There are some references to movies like 2001 and The Matrix, which are funny.This is a movie that\\'s going to be a game changer for the industry. Between the success of Barbie and the failure of movies such as The Marvels, there is going to be a change in how blockbusters for women are made. In the coming years, there will be much more of the former and much less of that latter. A lot of people were saying Barbie was snubbed at the Oscars. Robbie got snubbed for best actress, but Director is so stacked it\\'s not even funny. But the 1.4 billion at the box office will probably have a longer lasting impact than any technical Oscars.',\n",

Something about their perfect neon rollerblading outfits. I saw one preview and wasn't sure what the plot was going to be, I didn't care, I still wanted to see it. I wasn't expecting it to be amazing, but amazing it was. Well done!! Margot really knocked it out of the dollhouse. Ryan I'll never look at the same way way again. This 1980s Barbie Superman is very pleased. It won't be long until the opening dance scene is all over the clock app. I haven't felt so compelled to learn choreography since Michael Jackson's Thriller. Also, girls rule. Sorry, Ken.\",\n",

The only reason i kept going was the acting.

On the other hand, the way they staged Barbieland was amazing! Even though i\\'m not a big fan of bright colors i loved how they used the typical barbie pink everywhere.

I know they meant for this movie to be some deep philosophical message but it didn't work. The entire time I felt like the movie lacked intelligent enough writers to make it into what they aspired to create. I give 1 star to the first 30-40min of the movie- I like sattire and it was a bit like a sattire. I even laughed once ...Overall, I like the idea they had behind this movie. I wish they made it more philosophical and intrapersonal vs political and interpersonal. The moment she sits at the bus stop and has a sort of awakening moment, looking at the trees, the people, feeling empathy and the beauty of the world- that was great. I wish they went into that direction and ignored for once what is going on in the politics and just focused on a personal journey. It would have been a much better, deeper movie. It had its potential wasted. Like everything in Hollywood...Oh well!\",\n",

I actually cared about the characters, all the Barbies, all the Kens, as well as the mother and daughter in the \"real\" world. Will Ferrell was at his peak comedically.

Since I had read no reviews and had not talked to anyone who had seen it, I went in quite objectively. Our kids had a Barbie or two around the house, but they didn't rule their world. That said, I think I'm a pretty open minded movie viewer. This film is far from the phenomenon the press made it out to be. I enjoyed the incredible sets and recreations of the pink world. Also, the introduction to that world and all the Barbies and Kens was quite amazing. As others have said, however, is that it becomes wordy and preachy in the final third. I started looking at the clock which is not a good sign. The cast is good, although Ryan Gosling isn't dull enough to be Ken. He is never boring, even at the beginning. I'm glad I saw this because it is a cultural phenomenon (even though it doesn't deserve it). The message is a good one and spot on. It's just delivered in a less than stellar way.\",\n",

Instead the opening Barbie World sequence goes way too long, and then the 'real' world she goes to isn't just short, it's more plastic and silly than Barbie World. When she returned to Barbie World, I couldn't take anymore and switched off. My advice? If you're not hooked by the first 15 minutes, do the same. It only gets worse.\",\n",

              "  'So I headed to the cinema to watch Barbie, the new live-action adaptation of the beloved doll franchise. I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it fell short. Barbie takes us on a journey, with Margot Robbie portraying \"Stereotypical\" Barbie as she leaves her world of Barbieland and enters the Real World. She encounters friends, overcomes challenges, and discovers important lessons about herself and others. Barbie doesn\\'t always hit the mark while attempting to blend comedy, drama and fantasy elements. The plot feels predictable and filled with clich√©s, and the theme and tone are sometimes inconsistent and confusing. The acting and characters come across as stereotypes (something expected in Barbieland but not in the Real World).Nevertheless, Greta Gerwig\\'s direction is skilful and imaginative; Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt\\'s music is catchy and uplifting; Rodrigo Prieto\\'s cinematography is vibrant with a burst of colours. The movie also incorporates intriguing symbolism and production design by contrasting Barbie\\'s sparkly world with the realism of the Real World. The animation breathes life into Barbie\\'s world on screen. Amidst it all are some moments accompanied by clever dialogue-particularly from Ken (played by Ryan Gosling), who, as you would expect, serves as Barbie\\'s trusty sidekick, desperately wanting to be noticed and appreciated by Barbie.I had some issues with the movie because it only scratched the surface when exploring its themes. Throughout the story, Barbie touched on topics like death, unattainable perfection, gender roles, body image and self-esteem. However, it merely skimmed over these issues superficially, like snacking on junk food instead of having a substantial meal.Barbie isn\\'t a masterpiece. It\\'s not a disaster, either. It\\'s an entertaining film for kids and adults. The movie attempts to convey a message about embracing oneself and accepting others. It doesn\\'t do so convincingly or in an original way. It left me feeling amused and bored.Cute but shallow.',\n",
              "  'Pushing all of the serious reviews aside for a moment, this is a classic comedy of the thirties, updated for our times. Screwball comedies like \"Bombshell\" with Harlow and \"My Man Godfrey\" were wonderful satires. They centered around a battle of the sexes, with a female character dominant over the male lead. They were loaded with farcical situations and spoofing, as well as lots of physical comedy.And like \"Christmas in Connecticut\", they often had a gentle but serious \\'message\\' at the end, and America loved it. The woman is always smarter, generally with a plan up her sleeve, the male lead (most of the men in the movie) are oblivious. The more self-important, the more obliviousness they are to what\\'s really going on around them. I\\'d now love to see Ryan Gosling in a re-make of \"It Happened One Night\", he\\'d be terrific.

Basically Ken gets motivated by the idea of the patriarchy once he visits the real world but only went to the real world because of Barbie, who was there because of the woman that still plays with Barbie was depressed and, yeah, whatever. Oh and Mattel is run completely by men.I always wondered what a Barbie films storyline would look like. But this makes Barbie sound like a diversion to play into the fantasies of progressive, feminist, women. And maybe it is maybe it isn't. Mattel is making a serious case for the legitimacy and relevancy of Barbie, and the movie is really a two hour commercial for the toy. But it's worth it to explore dynamics between women and men. Who is in control of relationships, how men and women really need each other for more than just families and reproduction.In doing so we are back to the patriarchy and old fashioned traditional all American values but maybe that is all that life was ever about anyway. But then when the movie makes its point it gets away from itself, runs too long and gets campy again.The bigger picture is that Barbie, the film, gives us that movie magic we took for granted. And that's why I think it was so successful. It gives us something that has been missing from cinema for a while. But it is still a mediocre movie. Seven out of 10 for transcending that mediocrity at different times, but only seven out of ten for it's rhetoric. If women are given a choice, they'll probably want to remain in Barbie Land.\",\n",

The biggest letdown was the script, it is trying to be something more even though it's not. If they just stick to comedy instead trying to make this story deep and powerful which makes it dump because it's poorly done and stupid. I understand were was Greta Gerwing aiming at, but why so preachy why so forced. The thing is this movie takes itself so serious at one time and then not so much at another making it a mess. I think if they just stick to the musical comedy aspect instead of overly complicated dramedy, they could have got away with it.Overall this isn't the worst movie ever, it's still above average, the direction is good, the actors is good, everything looks good.

The music is dreadful, you can't tell one piece from another ... If this is what studio writers are thinking is creative these days , then the fact is they are wrong and at least as regards Hollywood, AI probably could do better and you should sack the lot of them ...

Ialdabaoth then creates humans in his image. Humans then excrete the civilization they love today.

I liked the little joke when Barbie says \"I\\'m not pretty anymore. I\\'m not \\'stereotypical Barbie\\' pretty and the narrator replies \" Note to the filmmakers: Margot Robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point.\" Even when they try to make Margot Robbie less pretty they can\\'t really achieve it. Robbie shines with charisma every time she is on a screen and this movie is no exception. Not only is she very attractive but her acting is superb as well.They also found perfect roles for Ryan Gosling and Will Ferrell. The roles fit their skill sets perfectly and made the best of what is overall a pretty unusual and scattered movie. The costumes in the film were also fantastic and probably helped tap into some nostalgia with people who played with Barbie\\'s before.The movies biggest issue in my mind was that it couldn\\'t ever really decide what it was. This led to an inability to achieve any momentum as you aren\\'t sure whether it\\'s going to hit you with silly jokes that were quite funny at times or whether you were supposed to scramble through the social messaging it was also clearly trying to send. The problem is especially clear when the two blurred together. I wasn\\'t sure whether some topics were serious social messages they are trying to advance or to simply be viewed as a joke.The ending made it all even more confusing. I don\\'t mind endings being preachy but it was unclear what the audience is supposed to take away from what went down.Overall I would have preferred if the entire movie was one big comedy , but I suppose the filmmakers knew best since they\\'re the ones raking in the cash right now.

Though after seeing Margot Robbie, it\\'s hard to imagine anyone else in that spot.Anyway ... like most moviegoers - I enjoyed this movie. It\\'s a lot like The Lego Movie with its high energy, colorful world-building, meta jokes, self-aware characters and variety of insider (fan) humor. The \"2001 A Space Odyssey\" beginning, (clearly aimed at adult viewers) was priceless.However unlike The Lego Movie I can definitely say that the first half was enormously more entertaining compared to the second. The first half was energized by all the Barbie accessories, character introductions, high-energy music and a very cool plot reveal involving the \"real world\".But unlike The Lego Movie, the second half (while not bad) wasn\\'t able to keep the momentum going. While there was a lot of action and drama ... it felt more hit-and-miss.The message was good: you don\\'t have to be perfect to be happy ... just be true to yourself. However, its delivery felt a bit too complex for kids - and maybe even for some adults.The empowering commentary about womanhood was eloquent ... but it seemed like the writers had trouble getting from that point to a strong and uplifting ending. It almost felt a bit melancholy for whatever reason.But - don\\';t let that stop you from enjoying this movie! There\\'s a lot to like and it\\'s kind of a cultural moment and opportunity to connect with all the Barbie-love that spans generations.

              "  'The first Barbie fashion doll was released by Mattel in 1954, there have been several straight-to-DVD computer-animated cartoons, but it has taken 64 for a live-action movie to be made. This was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, I certainly couldn\\'t ignore it, directed by Golden Globe nominated Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Basically, the film opens with the Narrator (Dame Helen Mirren) explaining the history of dolls before the introduction of Barbie (a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey) and how Barbie came to change the world. Barbieland is a matriarchal society where all ranges of living Barbie and Ken dolls reside. All the women are self-confident, self-sufficient, and successful, while the men spend their days engaging in recreational activities at the beach. All Barbies hold all important job positions such as doctors, lawyers, journalists, pilots, astronauts, and politicians. \"Stereotypical\" Barbie (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Margot Robbie) lives her best life all day every day, while her on-off boyfriend Ken (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Ryan Gosling) is only happy when he is with her, and she shows him some attention. Ken seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him to be independent and continue her female friendships. Barbie holds one of her regular parties at her Dreamhouse, which momentarily halts when she asks a question about mortality. The following day, Barbie finds her regular routine has altered, her raised feet have gone flat and she has cellulite. Her friends, including Writer Barbie (Alexandra Shipp), Physicist Barbie (Emma Mackey) and Lawyer Barbie (Sharon Rooney) tell her to visit Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a wise but disfigured outcast who was played with badly, giving her permanent splits and felt-tip pen drawn on her face. Weird Barbie tells her to cure her affliction, she must go to the real world and find the child playing with her. Weird Barbie does offer her the option to take her heal shoe and everything will return to normal but really wants her to take the second option (a parody of The Matrix). Driving her pink convertible outside of Barbieland, Barbie finds Ken stowed away, he insists he is coming with her, and she reluctantly agrees. Barbie and Ken travel by car, by boat, by rocket, by bicycle, by campervan, and by snowmobile (all deliberate cut-out scenarios), until they arrive at Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California. The two cause a stir while exploring, including with their colourful roller-skating gear and blades, then changing into cowboy outfits. At toy manufacturer Mattel, the creators of Barbie, the all-male board members are informed that Barbie has entered the real world. The CEO (Will Ferrell) orders her to be captured and brought to them to be put back in her box. At the local school, Barbie encounters a tween girl named Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) who criticises Barbie dolls for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards and attitudes about women. Meanwhile, Ken explores the city and learns about the patriarchal system, mistakenly believing it was all started by men and horses. It is through simple interactions with people that he feels respected and accepted for the first time; with everything he has learned he returns to Barbieland. Feeling distraught by Sasha\\'s comments, Barbie soon meets Sasha\\'s mother Gloria (Oscar nominated America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the person who was playing with her. Gloria is the catalyst of her existential crisis; she was playing with Sasha\\'s old Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Barbie. Soon, Mattel agents arrive and take Barbie to headquarters. They attempt to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha\\'s help. During the pursuit, Barbie enters a room containing a 1950s home scenario and encounters an elderly lady (Rhea Perlman) who recognises her. Returning to Barbieland, they discover that it has changed dramatically. The Kens have taken over, while Barbies have been reduced to submissive roles, such as maids, housewives, and agreeable girlfriends. Barbie tries to convince Ken and the Barbies to return to the way things were, only to be rebuffed. Barbie becomes depressed and returns to Weird Barbie and her group of discontinued dolls. Gloria gives an inspirational speech about society\\'s conflicting expectations of women, and Barbie\\'s self-confidence is restored. Meanwhile, the CEO and board members are making their way to Barbieland. With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Ken\\'s friend Allan (Michael Cera), a lone and discontinued character, and other discontinued dolls, Gloria repeats her moving words to all Barbies to snap them out of their subordinate behaviours. Ken intends to cement the changes to Barbieland and create male superiority by changing the constitution, allowing men to become President and replace all other roles taken by the women. The restored Barbies manipulate the Kens to fight against each other to distract them from the alterations. The Barbies regain their positions of power but also realise the errors of Barbieland\\'s previous societal system. They decide to make changes, including better treatment for the Kens and all outcast dolls. Barbie and Ken apologise to each other and acknowledge their failings. Ken feels that he has no identity or purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find himself. Barbie remains unsure of her own purpose and identity. She suddenly finds herself in a heavenly place where she encounters the elderly lady again, revealing herself to be the spirit of Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler. Ruth explains that she created Barbie as a toy that represented what girls \"wanted to be\"; she named \"Barbie\" after her daughter Barbara. After a montage of home footage of young girls playing, Ruth explains that Barbie\\'s story has no set ending. After the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives bid Barbie goodbye, she decides to become human and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband (Ryan Piers Williams), and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name \"Barbara Handler\", to a building for an appointment, and she enters asking to see her gynaecologist.

Robbie (who was snubbed an OScar nomination!) is gorgeous and perfectly cast as the loveable \"stereotypical\" Barbie going on an adventure, Gosling as the muscly, foolish, attention-seeking Ken is splendid, McKinnon is hilarious as the mangled Weird Barbie, Ferrera is good support, Ferrell is amusing, many other supporting cast members and the cameo performers are terrific, and the voice of Mirren (occasionally breaking the fourth wall) is great. Gerwig (who snubbed a direction Oscar nomination!) and her co-writer/real-life partner Noah Baumbach (Frances Ha, Marriage Story) were given full creative freedom for the script. They are unafraid to poke fun at the Barbie world, including many references to discontinued lines and how kids play with the toys, and interesting ideas of feminism, body image, female empowerment, the battle of the sexes, and the human experience. The visuals are sugar-coated and saturated with colour, pink obviously most prominent, with impressive set and costume design, and the soundtrack of catchy pop songs (\"Pink\" by Lizzo, \"Dance the Night\" by Dua Lipa) (the original \"Barbie Girl\" by Aqua does not feature?!, there is the new version by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice with Aqua) and fun song and dance routines. It could have been a conventional girly Barbie film with a dull love story or something and a happy ending, but it goes the other direction and benefits completely with its deliberately surreal and cheesy approach, a bonkers but inventive and worthwhile fantasy comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Original Song for \"What Was I Made For?\" for Billie Eilish and Finneas O\\'Connell (also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Song for \"I\\'m Just Ken\" for Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt (also nominated the Golden Globe), Best Adapted Screenplay for Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, Best Production Design, and Best Costume Design, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Original Screenplay, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, Best Screenplay, and Best Original Song for \"Dance the Night\" for Dua Lipa, Mark Ronson, Andrew Wyatt, and Caroline Ailin.

              "  'Before I start this review, let me start by saying that I used to be a staunch feminist. I\\'m certain that once upon a time, this film would have been right up my alley. I would have been nodding along with America Ferrera\\'s infamous 30-min monologue in the second act (was it thirty minutes? It felt like thirty minutes). I would have been cheering when the women finally wrested back power. I would have been disgusted at the instatement of the patriarchy in Barbieland.Now, this sort of narrative tires me, especially when it\\'s so cringy and on the nose. I was expecting true woman power out of this film - a glorification of all that it means to be a woman, especially since Barbie has always been the epitome of femininity. Instead, we have the same repackaged message that being a woman is a torturous, inferior experience, and that you must escape it at all costs. We have the same narrative that men are literal trash and that they will succumb to their basest instincts at first chance.Really, we have the same old, same old: \"Women can do it all\" - we cannot - \"Women don\\'t need men\" - yes, we do - \"Men are asinine, useless, selfish, and egoistic\" - sure, like all women are, if we\\'re making generalizations - \"Loving others by serving them is demeaning\" - serving others is the ultimate form of love and should be uplifted, appreciated, and glorified. Instead, this film shows women in maid costumes to make the point that serving others is h0rribl3!!!11!We were supposed to get a visceral reaction to this image of women as maids - and I did, because it was so artless, cringy, and reductive - and make the connection that the patriarchy enslaves us. What the patriarchy does is simply split labor. Men outside the home, women within. Is that inherently bad? Or does it simply make sense based on men\\'s and women\\'s distinct strengths, at least historically? We must question. You will likely have a different answer than I.I liked some of the messages at the beginning, namely that women are so often subject to impostor syndrome. That was beautiful, but then later on the film takes it upon itself to trample men to \"uplift\" women. I did not feel uplifted. I felt betrayed and pandered to, except I was the wrong crowd. It ignores the hardships of being the dominant sex: Being expected achieve, perform, earn more, lead, provide, protect, wear an emotionless facade. In some respects, women have it easier than men.When America Ferrera, whom I just want say I adore, was doing her monologue on how it sucks to be a woman due to what\\'s expected of us, all I could think was, \"Yes. There are certain expected behaviors of both women and men. It\\'s called basic public decency and decorum.\"For instance, men are expected to be dominant and aggressive, but not so aggressive as to be frightening. Men are expected to hide their emotions, but not be emotionless brutes. If we started on this route, we could pick apart just about anything.This sort of monotone, flat representation of our complex human experience works well to get a crowd fired up, but it\\'s ultimately reductivist. I walked away feeling like the director thought I was stupid.What I did like was the aesthetic, the much more subtle commentary on American consumerism, and the representation of teenagers are oversensitive militants. That\\'s it.',\n",
              "  \"Amazing to watch and delved into womanhood using incredible references. Weird Barbie was such a humorous touch but every part of humour managed to add to the true meaning of the film. Even weird barbie highlighted how barbie was exploited by some users for their enjoyment using her ridiculing and yet she's seen as ugly despite the true fun and amusement she's brought to the world. Amazing soundtrack aswell though I felt some songs couldn't be heard very well at all. Amazing performance from Margot Robbie but as Helen Mirren said she was the wrong person to cast for sympathy during that scene where she calls herself ugly!\",\n",
              "  'The most surprising thing about Barbie is that the joke gets old so quickly. Then, after it stops beating the audience over the head with its obviousness, it settles into a self-assured groove. It\\'s the rare case in which the third act is actually better than the first two. The jokes land harder once it sheds the need to be all things at once - a twist neatly mirroring the film\\'s central crisis moment.As it plays out, the first half of Barbie is surprisingly drab. It\\'s a feat of production and winking self reference that threatens to turn into a painful civics lesson and a generic every-genre-all-at-once lecture. It\\'s not nearly as weird or jarring as it needs to be, and ultimately, the Barbie world is as lifeless as the titular character.But then, something interesting happens: Barbie actually starts landing some punches. It\\'s no accident that a turn happens with the introduction of a fairly obvious twist - the introduction of a strange character played by Rhea Perlman. And Perlman is the perfect actress to fill such a role. She\\'s small, unglamorous, and crone-ish, consistently cast as either a venomous tough or as a matronly sieve. In Barbie, she\\'s a literal chorus, and her existence in the film suggests a knowing concession between the Corporate Barbie toy empire and the relationship that so many women have with her, and themselves.These are the topics that have long churned in Noah Baumbach\\'s films combined with topics that have defined Gerwig\\'s features, yet the movie doesn\\'t work like anything the two have accomplished separately. Barbie feels like Ladybird by way of The Life Aquatic, and when it allows itself to go full-blown existential, it manages a sort of cinematic brilliance that it\\'s rival blockbuster (Oppenheimer, of Oppenheimer, looming so large over everyone\\'s attempt at pretension) simply can\\'t manage. The film has deep flaws, but heart is not one of them.It\\'s a magical thing to see Margot Robbie cry, and while her performance really isn\\'t particularly consequential to the plot, it does present emotional heft to a screenplay that is both dullard and brilliant by design. Robbie, like Charlize Theron, is a beautiful blonde archetypal actress who just happens to be profoundly intelligent and intense, even when the film literally mentions exactly how we are not supposed to look at her as \"average\" while begging us to see her as just that. It\\'s a neat trick to pull off a genuinely flattering disrobing of stereotypical beauty. It\\'s a joke Robbie is in on, and a passive exclamation point that co-star Ryan Gosling owns.I like watching actors having fun onscreen. I actually never expected to experience this in Barbie, especially when it shoehorns in less-than interesting roles for Will Farrell and Kate McKinnon and quickly exhausts its post-subtlety messaging. Farrell and McKinnon are supposed to be two anarchical characters. Both fall flat. We\\'ve seen it all before, and here they lack any acidity whatsoever. Their roles feel tired after countless Toy Storys and Lego Movies treading on the politics of child/adult expectations of reality. They almost seem like add-ons from the corporate execs they lampoon - especially troubling in that McKinnon is supposed to represent anarchy. But Robbie and America Ferrera eat up the screen, both inhabiting a particular idea that seems to have genuinely spring from Gerwig\\'s best instincts. There are scenes that - in an overwrought and exaggerated cinematic world - seem to actually exist in real life. To get caught by surprise seemed impossible as the first act ground to a halt.Barbie is a little too blunt for its own good, which strangely ends up being a good thing. At just under two hours, the bludgeoning messaging stops being funny and you feel the fatigue that we\\'re supposed to understand is the source of Barbie\\'s angst. In that, the ending isn\\'t a reach so much as a confident nod to where Gerwig has taken the audience. If it\\'s rare to see a actresses having fun in a Hollywood film, it\\'s especially rare to see a female director genuinely flourishing by being just exactly who she is.',\n",

Nothing made sense, there was a really random depiction of what i think was supposedly to be a stereotypical man but it was like a weird distorted version like a fever dream, just really off but just barely accurate enough to catch. I think it was supposed to be comedic. There was a random like half hour where they pretended only women have certain problems and that somehow realizing that broke the girls from a spell that men had put on them by acting in that feverish dream version of \"manly\".

It skillfully addressed complex topics within a simple narrative, which captivated me. Despite its innocent appearance, the film was profoundly moving, evoking feelings of sadness, frustration, and anger. Watching it led me to embrace feminism but acknowledge that men also face their own issues. The movie's creator intended to shed light on the intricacies of being a woman, and the portrayal of Ken feeling left out highlights one of the many challenges women encounter daily in the real world. It made me realize how our society has always been so misogynistically setup.\",\n",
              "  'Written by Ian Chandler - July 21, 2023MILD spoilers ahead.\"Barbie,\" directed by Greta Gerwig, is one of the most bizarre films in recent memory. A popular toy tailored at young girls gets a chance at being one of the year\\'s best films. Its whimsical, funny marketing alongside its promising cast would suggest such. Unfortunately, the film botches that opportunity, but still has some fun moments. Even though it is not as funny as many other comedies, the film manages to stay in one\\'s head after leaving the theater.From its colorful presentation to its glowing characters, Barbie\\'s opening proposes that the movie will be roaringly entertaining. The music is great, the narration pokes fun at the Barbie brand, and the events are overly silly. Margot Robbie does a superb job at capturing the zany but stiff expressions one would expect from Barbie. Accompanying her is the equally funny Ken, who is played by Ryan Gosling. The two are fun to watch and their adventure appears to be one enjoyable time!Despite the promising opening, the film, like cheap plastic, breaks apart very quickly. Once Barbie and Ken go to the real world, the jokes are lazy and subplots are underexplored. The picture\\'s demographic is also confusing. What looked like a kids\\' film with humor adults can enjoy ends up giving discomforting questions parents have to discuss with their children. (For example, what a penis or a vagina means.) The sporadic sexual humor lacks a proper set up which makes for a lackluster punchline, resulting in cringey moments that, at the moment, raise questions for who this film is tailored for.\"Barbie\" also suffers from being a mostly directionless film, as its plot is unfocused but its message is very prominent. It sets up around three plotlines that were likely pitched individually and crams them all into one story with none of these concepts receiving their proper conclusions. It makes for a frustrating ending. The moral is also confusing and seems to spark more of a negative message than a positive one. Instead of the conflicts being resolved where everyone lives in harmony, it is a tug-o-war on which sex has the right to be selfish. It may make some viewers, especially impressionable children, think lower of both sexes or believe their gender is superior or inferior to the other. It may also cause some unnecessary dispute on the internet.How characters grow is another misstep from Gerwig. Many characters do not develop gradually, but abruptly. Barbie, Ken, and two other leading characters are almost unrecognizable to their third-act counterparts. It is difficult to root for any of them as they all aim to achieve their selfish desires instead of coming up with a plan where everyone is happy. If the characters were likable and the overall message was less overboard, it could have matched the quality its marketing advised.Even if it is a bit of a disappointment, there were some laugh-out-loud moments. Fourth-wall breaking jokes were well placed and parodies of other films or events were a joy. The production and music almost make up for the aimless story as it stays true to the brand but also makes the newer ideas feel fresh and organic. The choreography in some sequences is exceptional and, like its presentation, reinstates how fun Barbie and friends can be when it treats itself as a lighthearted comedy. It really could have been great if it were to stay in one direction.Barbie - 65/100\\nBarbie is a colorful, occasionally brilliant, but misguided comedy.',\n",

It was smart, funny, charismatic, visually pleasing and touching!It was both a perfect social commentary on the world today from a place of empathy and understanding for both men and women. From some haters online I thought it was going to be overly feminist (which I have no problem with) but I think it perfectly expressed how patriarchy is detrimental for men as well as women.But more importantly it was hilarious. Kate McKinnon stole the show, but the acting was solid all around.

Good to see different versions of Barbie over several generations.Story was not very strong, but this is more a visual show than anything.

While the plot, directing, and production value are good, it really is the cast that is selling this movie and I applaud all of them, supporting characters included.

In this new adventure, Barbie finds herself navigating the complexities of the real world, facing a stark realisation that men rule the world - much to Ken's delight.While this plotline may spark debate and offer an occasion for intellectual discourse, it's crucial to remember the intended audience of such movies. Given its 12A certificate, this film should not be regarded as a children's movie. Parents expecting lighthearted entertainment may be caught off-guard when sitting down with their young ones.For those who are able to appreciate its more mature themes and humour, moments of levity can be found. However, with a slow beginning that only picks up halfway through, some viewers may struggle to maintain interest. Furthermore, the film's rushed conclusion leaves much to be desired and falls short in satisfying fans' craving for a cohesive storyline.Potential audience members should weigh whether the departure from traditional child-oriented content is worth viewing or not.In summary, while this unique approach to a Barbie movie has its merits, it should be approached with caution by parents of younger children due to its mature themes and occasional tedium.\",\n",

It is PG-13 for a reason and also if you haven\\'t taught your daughter the word \"patriarchy\" yet, that might be something to cover first.Second, it\\'s not a paean to the Barbie doll, Barbie collectors, or Mattel as a corporation. Honestly, I\\'m not sure how they\\'re signed on as producers except perhaps to prove the point that the corporation is all about a cash grab.(The execs come across as buffoons and their talking points about being there for little girls are definitely shredded in the early encounters. No room to come back.)So while many went into the theater this weekend expecting a fun movie, not everyone will enjoy the show.---I personally thought it was ok--not as grand as expected, but I got to the end well enough.The acting was the fun part, especially Ryan Gosling as the air headed and thwarted Ken--voice of male fragility.Songs are catchy ear worms. The sets are marvelous pop art pink and scaled to make things look doll-like.The plot is a weak point, I\\'ll admit, being very simplistic.Honestly, however, I kind of expected that. (So unlike the women above neither stomped nor snuck out.)Mainly the message is to crush the patriarchy (ok--but where is Allan\\'s role in this patriarchy and why is a pregnant Midge so looked down on, even now?And since the ending sees Mattel theoretically still ramping production, what did we actually learn from this messaging anyhow?)If the pitch was to be a pivot to a modernized Barbie, I\\'m not sure that marketing campaign did any favors.

              "  \"This movie falls apart with any sort of critical evaluation. There are good and funny moments of the film, but I don't think the film is going to hold up in the coming years. It claims to be an examination of feminism through the eyes of this doll. The dolls think that they have solved the problems of the real world by their existence, a trip to the real world makes it clear that this is not the case. The Kens, who are an underclass in the fantasy world, stage a rebellion and take it over. The rebellion is put down and everything returns to the status quo. And the status quo is not gender equality, it's a ruling class and a subservient class. Stripping the ideology away from the film, the story of how this universe works doesn't make any sense. The dolls are the way they are because of the way that children are playing with them. So if there is sort of a matriarchal Utopia, it's because little girls and little boys who are playing with the dolls have created it. So the ending of the film doesn't make any sense because the Barbies say that they don't want to return to the status quo and the Kens are learning about the real me. But they're not real. They're dolls, and their realities are determined for them. That's not the only weird part about the movie, there's the scene where the creator of the Barbie holds hands with Barbie and shows her all the feelings of a woman so that she can decide if she wants to be real or not. But in that montage, are no scenes of pain and suffering. So this Barbie becomes a real person and is set up for a life of horrible suffering because she does not understand the reality of pain. She hasn't even had a stomach ache before, or even digested food before, and now she's going to be a real woman? I don't mind films having ideologies, but I think the way filmmaking is going is not a direction in which I can follow. Apart from superhero movies, which people finally seem to be tired of, modern movie making is more about the feeling of a story, than the story. And I think there are a lot of problems with traditional storytelling and films, like the fact there are never unhappy endings in Hollywood blockbusters. But the structure of storytelling is one which gives satisfaction to the viewer because they can feel the process of the story coming together, and if there's no actual story where is the satisfaction for the viewer?\",\n",

Barbie is looking for the girl who owned her in the real world. Ken hides in the back seat and comes along. At a certain point the movie becomes a story about the patriarchy suppressing women. There are some long speeches that really do not have a lot of emotional impact. At the start of the movie Ken is a puppet in Barbie world where Barbie controls everything, then it seems like they try to make the point that men and women don't need eachother and I don't think that is right. I think the movie should have been more fair to how men and women can be a great team in stead of being individuals and at odds. All in all I liked the movie, but it could have been better. If I'm saying that because I am a man and just don't get the plights of womanhood, then I'm sorry, but my experience in my own life is that it's not easy to be a man in this world of hours, I don't believe it's the case that men have all the advantages. Ken constantly confess his love to Barbie, but the movie says that his love is not real because he doesn't own Barbie. This to me does not represent men well. When I look around in the society I live in, I don't see men who own their women. I see men and women who love eachother and want to live together and I don't see what's wrong with that.

It has a cool set, lot's of creative choices and has good actors. With some genuinely funny gags and jokes.The cons: Some movies are great pieces of art, where you can't nail down what exactly the movie is about or trying to say. The classic disney movies like Beauty and the Beast, Peter Pan Pinocchio are good examples where they more about exploring ideas and themes.Then there some films like Atlas Shrugged where you know exactly what it's trying to say from the get-go. This is one of the those films, except it doesn't just focus on one message but three or four awkwardly placed one after another. This film felt like a first draft and could of used a couple rewrites to tighten it up.I don't think this film could ever decided what it wanted to be. And it tried to be too many things at once making it a little nonsensical. And all the main characters were brought together in a very inorganic way. There was even this car chase scene in middle which I believe they wrote in for strict purpose of doing a car commercial for Chevrolet.Also there were some very weird parts of the movie. Where the messaging was just wrong in so many ways. I'll just give one example and finish on that. At the end Barbie is sad because the patriarchy won but is roused when the mom did a rant about all the problems women have. But she is wrong, everything she listed weren't women problems they were people problems. That's life. I sorry but it's not the fact you are a women that you struggle with being either a respected boss or a liked boss. Go talk to Machiaveli. These are problems everyone has.Anyway that's my review.

The film's profound layers and sharp humor create an immensely satisfying experience, showcasing the best version of Barbie on a grand scale while embracing its wonderfully weird and unique qualities.Margot Robbie's casting as Barbie is spot-on, effortlessly transitioning between the eccentric Barbie Land and the emotionally charged real world. Her performance masterfully captures the character's essence, while her dynamic with Gosling's Ken adds depth and a touching parental undertone.Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken is nothing short of phenomenal. It's a note-perfect casting choice that allows him to showcase his impeccable comedic timing, reminiscent of his role in The Nice Guys, but dialed up to a whole new level. His character's journey culminates in a side-splittingly funny musical number.Will Ferrell, channeling his Lord Business persona, leads a hilariously caricatured team of executives in Barbie Land. This satire effectively highlights their out-of-touch nature, offering a clever commentary on corporate culture.America Ferrara's impactful speech and her heartwarming bond with Ariana Greenblatt contribute a layer of sincerity to the film. This relationship beautifully acknowledges Barbie's history while infusing the narrative with genuine emotion.Greta Gerwig's direction shines with a well-deserved bigger budget, evident in the stunning dance sequences, exhilarating car chase, and vibrant Barbie Land. The film's artificial nature paradoxically enhances its visual realism, setting it apart from conventional offerings.The soundtrack stands out with a stellar lineup of songs from top-tier artists. These tracks, much like the film itself, range from joyfully fun to deeply meaningful, seamlessly enhancing the overall experience. Barbie's music perfectly complements its narrative, creating a harmonious blend that resonates long after the credits roll.\",\n",
              "  'This movie was a big hype not only in the internet but also in the local radio and tv. This was a good reason to watch this movie. It was watched in a open place cinema. The audience flooded it more than its limit with a rate of 70/30 of females vs males.Let me be more results oriented.The movie was a rather hilarious with lots of funny scenes starting from the very start. Also think that he main scene in Barbie land was a place with plenty of plastic ware all highly magnified with real actors. She and Ken found a culture shock reaching the real world. Dialogues in the second half were quite deep giving a rather different moral then we cold expect raising the IQ of the movie until the end when barbie took a rather unexpected decision for her future life. Many political projections too definitely a movie for teens than children\\nGenerally the movie was quite bizarre in most of the story. Main actors were quite good\\nRating 6/10 the end was more interesting.',\n",
              "  'Got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I\\'m glad that I did. Here is my review written as a prententious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig\\'s latest directorial venture, \"Barbie,\" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unraveling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig\\'s live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie\\'s role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I\\'m giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.',\n",

I went with my girlfriend and her two daughters and they enjoyed it.The sets were all very very well done. They put a lot of time into them. The acting was awful, but awful on purpose? I'm not sure. The plot was confusing at times. I wasn't sure what that big battle was for. Why were they fighting? No reason or lead up to it was there.I really enjoyed the scenes when they were in the real world. They did good with the 'fish out of water' thing. I laughed a couple times.The sexual innuendos were there and I thought they were funny but thankfully my girlfriends daughters did not understand them.I would say a 11-13 year old girl would enjoy this.\",\n",

Even though the movie touched some subjects like the fact that a lot of girls grew up with Barbies and felt very insecure about their bodies (which I 100% agree with), and the right to choose what you want to be in your life, it felt uncomfortable; it felt as if all men in the movie were emasculated. In the world of barbie all Kens were uncomfortably stupid and only served for comedic purposes. I won\\'t give spoilers but in this \"perfect\" barbie world you would expect that they would achieve true gender equality since not only Barbie but the Ken dolls are also doctors, scientists, politicians etc etc.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling went above and beyond; I enjoyed their performances. Some scenes were also very funny but personally I did not like the ending.',\n",

It was hilarious, thought provoking, inspirational, and an all around great movie. Definitely geared towards adults but the jokes that may be mildly inappropriate (and I do mean MILDLY) will go over kids\\' heads. I loved seeing the character arcs and how each of them grew and changed ultimately for the better by the end of the film.

One of them are funny too, but at some point this is just cringe and too much.About the message of this movie, I agree with it and i like it because in our world women are really disrespected, harassed and so on, but at some point it was too much. I say this as a male, but one of my friends, who is a girl, has the same opinion. But the other one, with the mom and the teenager rebonding, that was amazing.The sound tracks are really good tho. To include artists like Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish and so on is a great move to make this film an iconic one.The cast is great and I think Margot Robbie played Barbie perfectly with her acting and her appearance too.In conclusion, I recommend this movie because I think this is a film that anyone has to watch because it's a Barbie one, and it can also teach teenagers a lesson, despite the cringe scenes.\",\n",

The message seems dated and naive. At best it's a bit of an eye roll, at worst it's an attempt to shame young girls into a self defeating thought process.Acting, sound track, set design, and some bits of comedy were really good, and there is some genuine cinema in there.\",\n",

The pacing of the movie was excellent as well. I never found myself checking the time waiting for it to end, i was engaged throughout. The comedy in the movie is very well done it felt fresh and not coming across as trying to hard. For me the best part was the end, that beautiful montage of women the cast and crew submitted to remind us that these women are all around us everyday and that we need to love eachother most of all. I will definitely watch it again.\",\n",
              "  'It\\'s taken me a couple of days to ponder over what I really thought of this movie. That\\'s a plus, in that it really made me think. However the more I think about it, the more turned off I am by the whole thing.Pros: The style is pretty fresh, and I was happy to see an original movie do well at the box office. Ryan Gosling was hilarious and nailed the balance between tongue-in-cheek and taking it super seriously. Simu Liu was great too. Taken by themselves, so many of the scenes were spot-on and funny, but the movie as a whole was just too much. That leads me to the negatives.Cons: Some of the Barbieland kitsch went on for too long and started to give me a headache. In the beginning when that song started up again for perfect day #2, I thought my brain was going to melt. The narrator was funny at first and then got annoying, especially when she started breaking the 4th wall. Some of the monologues (mainly THE monologue) would have read just fine as blog posts or opinion columns. In fact, I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ve read it before. In the movie it started coming across as buzzword-filled lecturing. I cringed whenever Barbie had a feminist lightbulb moment and used the academic-turned-popular jargon. Eventually it was like they were trying to get extra credit for using vocabulary words. Amusing at first, but got old fast.Finally, ironically, I (a mom...a very pregnant mom) went to see this movie with my own mom. For all the different kinds of Barbies out there, one type of identity Barbie isn\\'t allowed to have is Mother. The repeated gag where everyone cringes at Midge, the briefly shown \"pregnant friend\", told me this movie really wasn\\'t for me. The film took pains to show women of almost every description and identity category in positions of power in Barbieland, but the \"mom friend\" was the actual, unironic butt of the joke. I get it, she\\'s an awkward footnote in Barbie history. She DOESN\\'T fit into the Barbie message as stated in the film. I could\\'ve brushed it off as tongue-in-cheek like the rest of the movie, but it went further. That line: \"We mothers stand still so our daughters can see how far they\\'ve come\"? That shows me where mothers belong in this world. On the sidelines. Forever in the background, just a plot device. Or a joke. If you HAVE to have children, at least relegate yourself to your rightful role as the picture on the wall, history that no one wants to repeat. Even this movie, that satirizes the roles typically played by women in popular media by reversing the role onto Ken, still manages to keep one huge group of women in the-what shall we call it?-Ken-zone.',\n",

I can't wait to see what new wave this brings to our cinemas. And what stories it inspires in younger generations of female creatives. If you don't agree, you're missing the point. Watch it again and listen to the subtext. And look around you, how many people came wearing pink? Don't underestimate the pink pound!Coincidence that this came out with Oppenheimer? A juxtaposed way of telling a story, this film shows everything that's wrong with rom coms and drama and all genres. If you're a writer, producer, director, sit up and take note.\",\n",
              "  'I like most American girls raised in the 70\\'s and 80\\'s had a Barbie. I also had a Ken, but he was short lived as he had an unfortunate accident that led to his beheading. Having said that I loved the overall look of this film...it was fantastic. The pink was spot on, the Barbie convertible, her Malibu dream house, even the packaging of the Barbie box was so perfect it brought back a strange nostalgia for my childhood gone. The music was good...but I was saddened that they didn\\'t use Aqua\\'s song Barbie Girl for the film.I loved both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. I thought they were perfect in their roles as classic 1980\\'s Barbie and Ken. I was entertained by some of the comedy...like Barbie\\'s feet going flat, the trip to \"the real world\" concluding in them on roller skates on Venice Beach, Ken thinking the patriarchy had something to do with horses, the concept of misfit Barbie...which everyone has seen at least one of, the self mockery around failed Mattel products like earring magic Ken-pregnant Midge-Palm Beach Sugar Daddy Ken, and I loved the on going joke about \"who\\'s Allan?\".I thought the whole scene with the introduction of Barbie in its 2001 A Space Odyssey format was fantastic and realistic for the sentiment of its introduction.Where I started to fall off enjoyment-wise was in the degradation of Ken/Kens, who were made to be nothing more than himbos/mimbos who didn\\'t exist except for when Barbie turned her attention onto him making him this obsequious idiot.Conceptually I liked the idea behind the Barbie\\'s experience being tied to the girl playing with her (as is reality) and I enjoyed classic 80\\'s Barbie\\'s disillusionment with the real world where women weren\\'t really anything they wanted to be...like for example there wasn\\'t a single woman on the Mattel board. By the way I loved Will Ferrell! I didn\\'t know he was in the film and that was a pleasant surprise.Where everything really went south for me was when the real mother and daughter team up with the Barbies in Barbie World to distract Ken\\'s so they can reprogram the Barbies, deploying such tactics as feigning ignorance and interest. I found that to be a sad fiction imitating reality moment that just didn\\'t sit well with me...and then I was equally annoyed with all of the current political sentiments being added in.Overall however I think you should watch the film, so this is a recommendation from me...but I probably will never watch it again.My favorite scene in the whole film is right after a teenage girl at a table full of obnoxious and disgruntled teenage girls in counter culture garb tell Barbie that she is what is wrong with the world and that she has ruined their lives...dejectedly and with tears 80\\'s Barbie sits on a bench where there happens to be an older grey haired lady (no one ages in Barbie world) and she says to her \"you are beautiful\" and the older woman responds simply \"I know\". As a woman I wish that was reality...but in reality women aren\\'t allowed to show their age in Hollywood and are expected to continually look young spurning industries of plastic surgery and cosmetics and cosmetic procedures and diets etc. I wish we as a culture and a nation thought older women were beautiful...and I wish they knew it, making that scene bittersweet...but my favorite part of the whole film.',\n",

It pokes fun at the way society is but does it in a way that makes you really think about how you are living in this world. It has also made me decide to add more color into my everyday life as well!

              "  \"This review will sorta just be a barebones review. There's no spoilers because this movie doesn't really have a plot or resolution that can be spoiled. The movie starts out with a reference from 2001: a space odyssey, Which im sure went right over the target audiences heads. Then breaks into a lot of corny jokes in Barbieland. Barbieland is the best part of the movie, the Barbies performances are all hammed up, kind of like a long progressive commercial. But the acting is supposed to be corny and overacted because they're barbies so I'll accept it. Barbieland has a lot of fun moments with the songs and dances and the beach and Cena. The design of Barbieland and costumes of the Barbies and Kens is why this movie is getting this hype ans it definitely lives up to it. Margot Robbie does a good job as barbie and Gosling as Ken is by far the funniest/best part of the movie. Barbie starts her crisis and goes to the real world and everything starts to suck. Ken finding out about patriarchy is the best thing about the real w orld. The jokes in this movie were really weak, the sentimental serious parts are really boring, this movie feels like it's 2 and 1/2 hours and it's only 1h45. Will Ferrell shows up but they forgot to write jokes for him. America Ferrera gives the most genuine performance but her character is devoid of logic and ends up just giving a long lecture. Lots of the corny jokes in this movie fall completely flat, but theres so many jokes in this movie that you will laugh at least a little bit. Men are targeted in this movie and it has no idea what subtlety is, but it is a Barbie movie so i can accept that. And most importantly this movie has no conflict resolution at all, they sorta just end the movie on one last moderately silly joke. This movie was sort of just a forgettable comedy with a lot of hype before it. But hey I'm glad it brought people to theaters again and did have a message worth watching even if it was delivered rather weakly.6.2/10.\",\n",
              "  \"This movie is a cinematic catastrophe that leaves viewers questioning the very fabric of reality. This film takes a seemingly interesting concept and turns it into an excruciatingly tiresome and overhyped ordeal that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.First and foremost, the titular character, barbie, is an annoying and grating presence from the moment she graces the screen. Her incessant whining, exaggerated emotions, and dramatic outbursts quickly wear out their welcome. It's like watching a never-ending loop of a soap opera with no redeeming qualities. Barbie's character is not only unrelatable but also unbearable, making it impossible to invest any emotional connection with her.The premise of a doll coming to life and entering the real world could have been intriguing, but it's executed with such carelessness and lack of creativity that it falls flat. Instead of exploring the endless possibilities of this concept, the movie opts for mind-numbing clich√©s and uninspired gags. It's as if the writers couldn't be bothered to put any effort into crafting a compelling narrative.The film's overhyped marketing and anticipation only serve to underscore its crushing disappointment. It's as if the marketing team desperately tried to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, and the result is a movie that leaves you wondering if you could have spent those precious hours doing something more worthwhile, this movie is a regrettable waste of time and money. Its annoying and one-dimensional protagonist, coupled with a lackluster plot and sluggish pacing, make it a forgettable cinematic experience. I strongly advise against watching this film and suggest looking elsewhere for more fulfilling and entertaining movie options.\",\n",

I walked into the theater thinking it would be all fun and like any other Barbie animation made in the past, but it definitely stood out and all the actors did great. Most women will definitely feel a sense of courage to do what they want in life and maybe also the men.This was a 10/10 movie. Definitely recommend to watch.\",\n",
              "  'If forgotten, Ryan Gosling started off in the mickey mouse club. Important to remember because wow what a talented individual. Recent memory sees him leading roles that require a more stoic subdued approach, and it can be easy to miss his range. Barbie seeks to utilize all his acting muscles, and to a resounding success. He can sing, dance, act, and do comedy.It wouldn\\'t be totally outrageous to suggest he is the star of the movie. Of course, he is one of the stars, but I would posit he is THE star of Barbie\\'s movie.I was left wondering if the Ken story arc was the stronger theme of the film. Overall, I felt an absurdist philosophy underlined the film. There was a feminist message, sure, but it wasn\\'t as nuanced as Ken\\'s perspective on the patriarchy. At one point, Gosling\\'s Ken quips \"When I found out patriarchy wasn\\'t about horses, I lost interest.\"Ken\\'s attitude speaks to the idea that most likely the majority of men could care less about a patriarchy or how the world works. They\\'re on the ride like everyone else and playing a role in the fantasy of getting a gal to look there way. In essence, the reality is Ken is only Ken in relation to Barbie being Barbie and the truth is everyone is an Allan.',\n",

A real missed opportunity to take the discussion forward about changing society's gendered expectations for both men and women. Instead the writers chose our existing system - but with women 'in charge' - as the final outcome even though they had a whole imaginary world at their disposal to explore an alternative. This was not a kid's film but it was quite a childish treatment of an important topic. I fell for the marketing campaign though!

I also loved the fact that all the barbies were not all skinny and blonde .

That may be the problem: verbally explaining through Baribe and Gloria's line most of the time rather than portraying what the problem is. It's like my mom giving me a lot of wonderful advice, but what changes me the most is what I see with my own eyes. To get the message crossed, 'Barbie' loses the tension of the story as time passes.'Barbie' is upbeat, bright, and cheerful; the comedy aspect really works for adults as well. The first half is really great and engrossing, but from the part where Barbie & Gloria and Mattel people go back to Barbieland, it loses power and attractions. 'I'm Just Ken' sequence is boring, and how Barbies solve the problem is super easy and simple because it's in Barbieland. I feel even defeated how gender inequality is treated this lightly and carefreelySoundtrack is the best quality. Billie Eilish's song at the end almost saves the film. Four-minute song captures more essence and core of 'Barbie' than the film itself.\",\n",

Still what impressed me the most was the writing! Greta and Noah wrote a masterpiece film that explores while criticizing the good, the bad, and the ugly in the flaws of human nature in the eyes of Barbie and Kent in their fun adventure in the real world and the imaginary one. What was outstanding in this fun ride is the ability to combine all these meaningful feelings and emotions in one movie in a light sarcastic theme and not forget to present the real issues in our world nowadays and the conflict while analyzing the diverse ideologies that clash in this mess, all of this was done through an objective talented lens.',\n",

There was much I enjoyed about it, but I\\'d have loved to have know less about it heading in.Having previously lived a joyous and perfect life in Barbieworld, stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) starts to have intrusive thoughts about her own mortality, she discovers cellulite on her legs and her feet go flat. Having visited weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) who explains that to cure these issues, she must travel to the real world and bond with her owner. Ken (Ryan Gosling) only experiences his worth when he\\'s seen by Barbie and, whilst not invited, accompanies her on her adventure. Whilst Barbie learns that her assumptions about Barbie\\'s positive effect on the real world aren\\'t at all accurate, Ken discovers a concept that can revolutionise his life, the patriarchy.I am far from the first person to comment that \"Barbie\" is much cleverer, grown up and subversive than it might have been expected to have been, in the hands of other film makers. Gerwig though, constructed a tale that manages to be a love letter to Mattel\\'s iconic character, an honest appraisal of the same characters legacy, a treatise of the position of women in the world, a considered look at male relationships and funny comedy at the same time. It set design and cinematography are great, as are the performances from a surprisingly Anglo-centric cast.Why haven\\'t I scored it even higher then? Mostly it\\'s my fault, the film has been so dissected and meme-field on Twitter that, even though I wasn\\'t actively looking for it, I knew many of the beats and surprises before I saw the film. I thought that perhaps the films songs could have been a touch better, I know people like them, but I can\\'t really remember any of them just a couple of days later.I\\'m annoyed, but not surprised that the lesson Hollywood seems to have immediately taken from this is not, lets let interesting and varied filmmakers have carte blanche to turn properties into interesting films, but instead it\\'s \"movies about toys!\".

As her journey unfolds, Barbie\\'s exploration of empathy and self-discovery resonates profoundly with audiences, reminding them of the significance of creative freedom in cinema.

Ryan Gosling as Ken is probably the most consistently funny aspect of the film, and he also gets to belt out what is probably the best original song in the film.I can\\'t help but feel the whole \"fictional world meets the real world\" aspect of the film could have been made stronger by having the \"real world\" be more rooted in realism and less exaggerated.

The complete opposite of Barbieland.I hope that people can take away from Barbie and Ken how the roles were reversed when they went from Barbieland to the real world and you could see Barbie becoming very anxious and self-conscious, while Ken became very self-confident, felt amazing he felt empowered immediately for the first time in his life, and you could almost see him go from proud to being a man to toxic masculinity within one scene.The teen angst was a good part too. Barbie was empowering to millions of girls but not to everybody. She has also given millions a very severe complex about body image, pretty privilege and society accepting them only if they look a certain way and Barbieland totally emphasizes that.Even the biggest Barbie was well done up. Dresses well hair done speaks delicately.Everyone there was picture perfect. Dainty and feminine. Even the Supreme Court were beauty pageant champions.This movie is actually deeper than I thought it would be. It was really good I really like Margot Robbie I think she's absolutely adorable as Barbie and I felt bad for her for most of the movie because she went from being a brilliant, beautiful and inspiring idol to some cat called bimbo with pretty privilege in the real world that they wanted to just put in a box.\",\n",
              "  \"When I saw they were making Barbie I thought it was a stupid idea and that I would definitely never watch it. Well, never judge a movie by its subject! I gave it a chance and I was pleasantly surprised. The overall concept elevated the film beyond what I had anticipated. Greta Gerwig and husband wrote a screenplay that attached Barbie to the wider, real world. This added a smartness and depth that went beyond the doll's fairytale that I had expected. The production design was pure genius. The tone, politics and the Barbie doll's status in the real world were all handled deftly. The characters and their interplay were hilarious! And the acting was all of a high level. Gosling stole the show with his Ken portrayal. He surprised me with the Oscar level performance he gave. All in all, it was smartly funny and brilliantly written and directed. Just pure, simple, light fun! I watched it twice and it was even more funny the second time around. I could easily see it becoming a rewatchable, perennial favourite. A classic comedy.\",\n",

And if all of that is also true for a doll...\"Bro I was so excited just to look at the beautiful painted sets and watch the beautiful Barbies and Kens wear goofy clothes...but this was a deep movie.The seemingly perfect matriarchal world of Barbie has has a sudden setback when the perfectly Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie)\\'s heels land flatly on the ground.Barbie has to leave Barbieland through a surreal theatrical series of vehicles to wind up in California, where she meets her creators at Mattel and others.Of course Mattel, one of the producers, wanted to paint themselves in a positive light. They probably over-emphasize their importance in the playroom (They assert Barbie was the first doll to not be a baby doll, the first opportunity little girls had to play at being something other than a mother, which I find hard to believe). But there is definitely some honest criticism in the movie of who Barbie is and what she represents. Does Barbie make women feel bad about their bodies? Maybe.There are also a couple very playful moments where it feels almost like it feels when one plays with toys. Made me think of the Lego Movie (Which also had Will Ferrell in it).Then there\\'s the characters. There is humor. There is music. There are of, course, gorgeous people and sets. But most of all, there is self-actualization and growth.I love every line in this film. I keep thinking about it. I\\'ve seen the movie twice now and I hope to see it again. Please watch it. Prepare to cry.',\n",
              "  \"First impressions of the movie where mixed. The script is pretty much garbage. It sends a solid message about equality while somehow does the exact opossite.It tries to create a society where men and women are at the same level and all bodies and races have the same value but also does the opposite making sometimes girls look much inferior than men and men inferior than women.The movie is about laughing at how basic, stupid and ignorant the fan base of the movie really is. If you went to the theater wearing all pink and well dressed then you are what I'm talking about.I must say it was a fun movie that made me laugh at some points. It was so fun to see how ignorant the people watching this movie are that made me also laugh and be worried about how the society has fallen. I went to see the movie making a double session after seeing Oppenheimer so that may be why I notice the difference about the audience.If you are a girl and you laughed a bit too much then maybe you should go and search for a psychiatrist because if you like being made fun off then you have some problems.Basically, if you are a guy taking over a girl then you are bad. If you are a girl taking over a guy then it's all good. The movie supports the extreme left, politically btw.At the same time it also teaches guys and girls that they don't need each other and can live by their own. It's a journey about finding yourself and what it means to be a guy or a girl. It tries to take out stereotypes by saying all bodies are perfect but when Barbie gets cellulitis it's then she is ugly and wants go back to be perfect and to the usual stereotypes. Also let's include fat barbie and paralytic barbie but for some reason let's not include fat Ken or paralytic Ken and just make them all gorgeous and fit, clearly not body-shaming guys...If you are wondering why I haven't spoken about any of the plot, well... that's because there isn't one besides vibes and ideologies.I was also surprised in the good way for not having woke characters or members of the lgbtqi+ comunity. If there is a movie for it, it's this one but I'm glad they did not force any of that.It's sad to see that almost all the audience just went there to show off their pink outfits, tell everyone they have watched the movie by taking pics before or after the movie and to stay on their phones instead of watching it. I came out of the movie worried about where society is going and I think that was not supposed to happen.\",\n",

As expected the movie looks great, Barbieland is a crazy set, shot well and all actors are committed.Was a bit disappointed with Gosling but could just be the writing/direction for him. Margot Robbie and America Ferrara shine the most, and to a lesser extent Gosling, Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell (those last two are smaller side characters).Some issues with pacing or maybe the movie should've shorter, and the music wasn't all that memorable surprisingly. I would've like more songs or better yet for this whole movie to be a musical!My biggest gripe is the writing. It is painfully heavy handed, preachy and full of cringe. This is because the evil patriarchy and righteous feminism is ramped up to 100.I honestly kept checking my watch, was looking at uber's home with like 30-40min left, and struggling so hard not to walk out (i never do, always stay to the end no matter what!) or fall asleep. Maybe it was partly because I had just gotten out of the 3hr Oppenheimer (which I had a strong coffee during) but this was one of the toughest movies I had to sit through in a theater in a very long time.I think most, but still probably not all, women will enjoy it, but for the fellas? Unless you're a self described male feminist or far-left politically, or maybe just a simp, your mileage is really going to vary and this may not be for you.I like Greta Gerwig and the cast but this was a big miss and let down for me. Messaging aside, I struggle to give this higher than a 5, maybe a 6 at the absolute best, wouldn't give it lower than a 3. So I'm going with 4/10.\",\n",

It brought forward self awareness, emotional intelligence, and so many insights into ones self.This movie is a must see for all women and men who are open to growth and developing their mindsets.As a millenial this movie resonated on another level, it reminded me of the self I was at a younger age, before falling into societal norms.Will definitely watch it again and again.\",\n",
              "  'Barbie (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Barbie in a perfect world who believes she is the perfect role model for little girls in the real world. When things start feeling off for her in her world, she discovers she may need to go to the real world to set things right. When she gets to the real world, she discovers how wrong she was about being the perfect role model.This movie is directed by Greta Gerwig (Little Women) and stars Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Issa Rae (Insecure), Kathryn McKinnon (Bombshell), Ryan Gosling (The Notebook), Alexandra Shipp (X-Men: Apocalypse) and Will Ferrell (Elf).This movie had a lot more going for it than I anticipated. The universe and characters are very well developed, thoroughly put together with the history of the Barbie universe incorporated and a smart scripts. The dialogue and interactions were much deeper than I anticipated. There were a lot of good messages and lessons baked into the storyline. My only complaint was how much focus there was on the \"Ken\\'s.\" He was a worthwhile villain, but the ending dance scene and finding self moment was overdone; however, everything about the Barbie plot hit the nail on the head.Overall, this is better and deeper than I expected and was definitely worth a watch. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it.',\n",

              "  'I went into Wednesday expecting to write things like \"the greatest weekend in cinema\", \"Oppenheimer brings cinema to the screen again\", \"Barbie wins the weekend\"... But this is so much more than that.Barbie was perfect. It shows something that I was able to experience for the first time in my life: the artistic pleasure of movies as a communal and cultural experience. Although watching Titanic was one of the greatest communal experiences of my life, it\\'s the immediate cultural relevance of Barbie that makes it a first for me. It\\'s the best that movies can be. And above all else, in six years time this might be looked back upon as one of the best movies of the decade.In the consumerist world\\'s perfect fantasy sold to little girls as a toy-the polished plastic world of Barbie-everything is perfect. Starting with Barbie herself. Until the doll experiences something all too common to the real world but inexplicably strange to hers: an inexplicable desire to die. We get acquainted with the situation following a musical set-piece opening of the kind that tells you you\\'re in for a great ride! (A pleasure made double for any Dua Lipa fan!)As it turns out, someone in the real world (Gloria (America Ferrera) a woman working an office job at Mattel) has communicated these emotions to her. It\\'s now up to Barbie to travel to the real world to repair the rift in the space-time continuum. Her typical but good guy boyfriend Ken joins in for the ride.In the sweet and softhearted comedy that follows, Ken and Barbie make their first encounter with the real world, where Barbie finds out she\\'s only ever sexualized, and Ken is treated with a newly discovered respect that he never knew in the Barbie world. Gradually, he discovers the patriarchy. When Barbie finally meets Gloria and her teenage daughter (beautifully cast and great showing from young Ariana Greenblatt) after they help her escape a chase with the corporate goons at Mattel that preside upon the cubical empire, the journey is done and they happily return to Barbieland. Only there\\'s one problem: Ken has brought the patriarchy back home!With the visual representations of masculinity in popular culture (pretty much Rocky Balboa), outrageous rocker outfits, and a great fancy of horses (I share this with Ken I have to say), Ken has now amassed all the aesthetics he needs to firmly establish the rule of the patriarchy in Barbieland. The comedy is bafflingly funny, and the subject is urgently topical.I\\'ve lately had the feeling that movies today weren\\'t as important as they used to, that they didn\\'t mean as much and like Quentin Tarantino said and I agree, \"they\\'re not in the zeitgeist (the spirit of the age).\" This movie was right in the zeitgeist!It\\'s thanks to a collaboration between Warner Brothers, Mattel (kudos to them for having the sense of humor), and an artist like Greta Gerwig that we\\'re able to have her take something so deeply established in the pop culture and marry it with the standalone work of an artist and its integrity. The result is something I\\'ve never seen in a theater before.In a scene where Barbie is experiencing an emotional breakdown, Gloria transitions into a long-running monologue about how it was like for her to be a woman in today\\'s world. I sat and watched and thought it might had been something a bit clich√©d and worn out. Everyone had settled into silence. Then the moment Gloria was done with the monologue, there was a pause, with her and with the audience, then the whole room erupted into applause! I joined right in! What the hell did I know... When the movie kept getting more and more exciting, and just transitioned into a modern-day musical set-piece this time around, people were so with it they had to applaud again. It was a truly great thing to see. (US audiences and people in Marvel movies are known to cheer for many things, but this was a different degree of sincerity.) At the end of it there was a buzz in the room, like everyone had just been part of something special.Essentially you know it\\'s a great situation, you have no idea where the movie might go next, and it keeps coming up with the right answer every single time. It\\'s perfect.More props to Greta; like all the truly great movies, it\\'s also very personal. At first it\\'s personal in the relevant but quirky mention of Rocky Balboa and The Godfather as symbols of the male-revolving world-movies that she herself wanting to be a filmmaker had had to deal with as deeply cherished and highly regarded in the masculine opinion around her-and it\\'s personal again in the ending, and what she sees as most cherishable about being human, in what will stay with me as one of the classic shots of all time. The shot comes with Margot Robbie\\'s perfecting of the single-eyed tear and using it the way you imagine they would in the great old times of cinema, except it\\'s that much better because the times are today.I\\'ve seen reviews (The Guardian) calling this a feminist thesis. It\\'s neither a thesis (see Women Talking) nor a dogma. It\\'s entirely cultural. And despite the story largely being a comedy about women banding together and helping each other break free of the omnipotent clamps of the patriarchy, Ken, who is an absolute joy in this movie, is treated to a delicate ending as well. The role was also a total gift of a role and Ryan Gosling was right there for it.It\\'s also the movie\\'s quality as a journey of spiritual discovery, confrontation, and self-actualization, along with the great tradition of the Hollywood ending, that bring everything together and make this a proper pop culture opus.As far as what this implies for the industry, this is the first time that we\\'ll be able to have a strongly established director that isn\\'t one of the folks who made their name in the 90s. This is not to say that Greta Gerwig is now going to make a Barbie every other year, nor does she have to. This is her Pulp Fiction, her Raiders of the Lost Ark, and dare I say her Godfather (wink wink). May she enjoy it. But she\\'s definitely on my short list now of the most exciting directors working today, and someone that can carry the torch of great cinema wherever she goes next. I remember hearing her answer with Singin\\' in the Rain (1952) to a favorite movie question in a roundtable interview, and thinking who was this girl. Then I happened to see Singin\\' in the Rain a month later, and I knew that girl was cool.Finally, I\\'m glad that an entire generation of young girls gets to grow up with a movie like this available to them. It\\'s definitely not something Greta\\'s generation had, not quite. It\\'s also a culmination of the last ten years of popular culture, which is why I think it\\'s one of the best movies of this period. But it\\'s also gonna be remembered and talked about for decades to come. And based on its feminist scope, it might be already one of the most important movies of the 21st century.',\n",
              "  \"Plagued by strange un-Barbie-like thoughts, Barbie (Margot Robbie) leaves 'Barbielend' for the 'Realworld' (along with tag-along Ken (Ryan Gosling)) where she (as a doll) has been rejected by a child, only to discover that the male-dominated Realworld is not to her tastes. The film has some fun moments (especially in the first third) and fabulous imagery but the social-messaging was a bit heavy-handed and I quickly lost interest in the story, especially during the interminable and unmemorable song-and dance numbers. Anyone interested in a parody of 'Mattel's Barbie' would be better served watching 'Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy' (Simpsons s.5, ep.14), which is much more clever, funnier, and a lot shorter. Evidence that 'Barbie' has not shamed me out of my gynophilic mindset: I rated the movie an extra star simply because Margot Robbie is soooo pretty.\",\n",

He has eight abs, of course, but he also gives a surprisingly good performance. The film has a positive message about self-acceptance. Barbie learns that she doesn't have to be perfect to be loved and accepted.The film does have some flaws. The plot is a bit predictable, and the film could have been a bit shorter.

(It\\'s actually half female.)The high point of the movie comes in the opening minutes. I fell in love with that spot-on \"2001\" parody, even though it feels like an inspired afterthought.

But that being said, I learned very late that Greta Gerwig was the director of this film, and therefore, was not prepared for the emotional journey I was about to be taken through.This movie was unique, creative, fun, and so special. The music was excellent, the cast was wonderful, the costumes were amazing, it was funny, and the choreography was fun.As for it's flaws, this movie did have some uneven pacing. I felt that some side plot stuff was unnecessary (namely, most of the Mattel chase). Sometimes it was just very confusing for the sake of making audience members existential, the ending felt abrupt, and there was little justice by the end of the movie (though perhaps this was more of a conscious choice on behalf of the filmmakers to convey the endless, feminist fight).I was happy to see how this film really explored the female experience. From growing up to objectification by men. I was shocked to see Ken claim to love Barbie, only to objectify and hurt her later on; it was truly reminiscent of many elements in real life. Overall the tone and look of this movie was very unique and I enjoyed it a lot.I didn't expect to cry during the fun, silly Barbie movie I had been so excited to see, but I'm glad it was as emotional as it was.\",\n",
              "  \"The Barbie movie is a mixture of comedy and an analysis of an old era idea, using scenery that rivals classics like Playtime, and a cast that was clearly hand-picked with stars like Margot Gosling and Farrell. The movie features an astonishing soundtrack, including Ice Spice, Dua Lipa, Tame Impala, Billie, and much more. Barbie's presentation is top-notch, and some might even say it couldn't be any better (I would've agreed). However, the writing itself doesn't quite match its other impressive traits. Despite adapting the boring and monotonous toy line into something actually interesting on the big screen, it felt throughout the movie that the ideas of the writers were too disjointed. This led the director to piece together a self-exploration story with a modern world outlook, topped with media manipulation and a critique of society from a male perspective, with a side dish of a womanly critique of society. Safe to say, not every point got across as intended.The plot starts in Barbie Land, where we witness Robbie's character's journey and her existential quest. Concerned for her designated child's fate due to the villainous scholiosis, the tall blonde takes action. The movie's second part shifts to real-life segments, offering hilarious situations with Ken & Barbie. The perfect doll believes she's found her child but faces an unwelcome surprise, realizing the world is the opposite of her magical land; nobody admires loving Barbies, and the Kens are the ones in control. In contrast, the muscular blonde embraces and reshapes his former land into a fratboy utopia. After finding her true partner in the child's mother and returning to Barbie Land, the toy discovers its destruction under a horse-loving, Mojo Dojo Casa House Living, and beer-drinking government. With a pep talk from her former playmate, she learns about womanhood and reclaims her home using girl power.And this, without the inclusion of Matel and the ending. It tries to reach for the stars with the juggling of three major themes, but it has the wings of Icarus, represented by its 2-hour runtime.The main three themes are the search for one's self, the media prying on those who are deeply insecure, and the question of womanhood's position in society. However, not all themes were treated equally. The search for one's self, for example, had a great realization with the protagonist slowly becoming different from the others, becoming weird as the movie put it, and ending with the pursuit of reality, not succumbing to a safe bubble but embracing the truth fully. On the other hand, the theme of womanhood feels somewhat forced in the end, taking away from the main conflict.The movie starts the process of exploring this theme with the conflict between Barbie and the child of her owner, showing that Barbie isn't as glorious as she felt. However, after this, nothing truly develops. The kid joins the journey and sees that Barbie is a woman just like her, which doesn't really correlate with anything before that. To be honest, it feels more like a relatable moment rather than an actual thing, but I guess that is what solves the big Kenland problem. The middle ground gets taken by the character arc of Ken, and his performance steals the show, but the way it's solved pretty much trivializes the issue Ken was facing, making it an unsatisfying ending that boils down to 'Men are big dumb-dumbs' is extremely unfortunate, as it was, in my opinion, the most interesting part of the movie. However, you can't really rival 'I am just Ken' part.Something even more unfortunate was Farrell's character. He's such a good actor, but he was incredibly wasted in this role. I understand that it's a Barbie movie and kids will be there, and making the man in the suit dumb will make hilarious jokes for toddles. However, couldn't they you know, not put Farrell? His role doesn't really scream expertise, and other than that, they aren't even plot-relevant. I feel like if they just cut this part entirely, the movie would have had a lot more to gain. Besides, the movie is PG-13, so they don't really need to consider slapstick comedy (sorry for offending Mr. Bean Fans).In conclusion, the Barbie movie is surprisingly more than Ken-ough. It provides an amazing soundtrack and even better performances. However, it didn't deliver that well in its plot points. I wouldn't say it's a must-see, but you might be missing out if you don't watch it.\",\n",

Which is odd since it's about the most iconic doll of all time.The creation of the Barbie world was awesome: sets and props. But the preachy and messy plot about the patriarchy didn't impress, and neither did the resolution of the story. How about promoting a world where neither men nor women have to have the majority of the power over each other? Some of the dialogue in this movie was literally incoherent babble. Also, they didn't have to pointedly throw in that Barbie was drinking cow milk- cow on the label in all caps. Are the writers anti vegan? At least they mentioned in the film to the audience that Ken was wearing faux fur, but it was like a condescending little note because I guess they assume people care more about fur industry animals than they do about the masses of exploited cows. Anyways, the best parts of this movie were: Ryan Gosling all the way (gorgeous, funny, singing and dancing,) the conflict between the two alpha Kens and introducing me to Simu Liu and Issa Rae.

They want Barbie to be about individuality and self-determination, and that\\'s all well and good; but there\\'s still a corporate brand behind the curtain, even despite the gags (Will Ferrell) alluding to that ironic hypocrisy, such as the groveling admission about \"one or two\" previous Mattel CEOs being women, amongst a long line of men.That aside, on its own merits as a film this was very preachy and very convoluted throughout, the crossover between the two \"worlds\" was a really cool idea that just needed more development and streamlining to land properly. Barbie was well cast (Margot Robbie), as was her playboy, Ken (Ryan Gosling) and the comic relief alter-Ken, Alan (Michael Cera). Many of the ingredients and characters for a good film were present, but the execution fell flat.Somewhere beneath the political hullabaloo the film contains a valid message about mutual respect between the genders and a lesson on self actualisation. But ultimately, the film forgot that Barbie and Ken could have had some *fun* whilst also making the points the film set out to make. Making many of the characters superficial Kens or Barbies made the palette a boring and grating one, even despite the points that were trying to be made about individuality. The film also often lacked the light touch needed to captivate young girls who actually play with Barbie dolls and who won\\'t necessarily understand the high level commentary at play here. Even if a mum or elder sister explains it to them afterwards.',\n",
              "  'Barbie blew my expectations away. I have never seen such a brilliantly written movie that makes me want to immediately rewatch. Every detail was thought of in Barbie\\'s world and the satire of the Ken\\'s and patriarchal society was hilarious and relatable as a woman. The dialogue was perfectly childish (as if children were playing with the barbie\\'s speaking) and intelligent. America Ferrara\\'s monologue about the hardships of being a woman was spot on and every woman in the theater could relate. The movie was fun and heartfelt while also drawing attention to society\\'s imperfections. Men who say this film isn\\'t good or \"anti-man\", is part of the problem.',\n",
              "  \"The film was entertaining enough but only just. I think if it hadn't had Ryan Gosling in it, it would have been something of a snore fest which is ironic as it was aimed to be a female vehicle.I understand the premise of Barbie wanting to go to the real world in order to find a cure of becoming human. However, it's not a very well rounded tale. There's the odd amusing scene throughout until the Ken dance/song near the end, which ends up being hilarious and has added a good two stars to my review.It takes itself a little bit too seriously at times when really it could have done with a bit more humor. Overall not bad.\",\n",

Thank God the runtime is short. I'm still trying to figure out who actually are the target audience for this. It's neither for kids nor for teens nor for women nor for men. I don't understand the point for making this movie. It begins very well, but tumbles down from there. Real-world seems more cartoonish than the Barbie world. That could be the real reason for Barbie to come out of Barbie-world and turn into a human. Relatability to any character is zero.What waste of two hours of my day!\",\n",

Though the Micheal is obviously mainly about Barbie, Ken has his own moment to shine that ends up being the subplot.The movie was beautiful visually and funny from beginning to end. The attention to detail was clear and the storyline had the theater crying happy tears by the end. Definitely see it if you are a parent and take your parent friends with you. Make sure you wear pink ;)We would see it again and again!',\n",

Turn your brain off and enjoy a fun ride, my only major criticism is some badly written dialogue that seems weirdly out of place in such a high profile movie. Specifically, I mean the overuse of the unnecessary word \"literally.\" That really yanked me out of the smooth ride in an otherwise well produced film where everything else is top-notch and the big budget shows. Apart from my previously mentioned criticism the dialogue is as funny as should be expected in a lighthearted fun film. In conclusion, I would recommend this as it is slightly above average, especially given its cultural significance as a phenomenon.',\n",

There Barbie founds out very upset things,but Ken the exact opposite. He brings his knowledge of patriarchy into Barbie land and everything goes upside down. In the end Barbies and Alan save Barbie Land.I strongly recommend Barbie. It shows very important things ,has wonderful soundtracks. I really loved this film.',\n",

There were so many fun little details and overall they nailed the mood this movie needed.What I did not like are these cringe songs. I would have left those out entirely. Also, towards the end, there was a part (a dialog), which felt really forced to me. At that point even the cinematography was terrible.We will talk about this movie for years, but most of it will be due to its clever marketing campaign, and Barbenheimer memes. However, it is not something I will re-watch in the near future. I'd even go as far as to say it's a one-time watch.\",\n",

The set was incredible and the dances were amazing which really added to the story line. The ending was perfect and showed how barbie has impacted audiences positively and negatively. Mattel really own the so called bad barbies that they discontinued and it is clear either why they were discontinued but also maybe why they weren't necessary to be discontinued. Overall a great film and good to see with the family, it would be really recommended if you have younger children! They should love it.\",\n",

The vibrant pink color that permeated the film brought back memories of my childhood, when everything seemed so vibrant and full of life.What struck me most about the movie was that it wasn't a typical superhero genre movie, which is so common in today's movie industry. Instead, it was a live-action non-comic book movie that was a breath of fresh air.The movie sets were stunning, with wild and imaginative backgrounds that were so fun to see on a beach. The foreground was equally as enjoyable, with standees that added a touch of whimsy to the film.As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but feel like a kid again. The childhood thoughts and memories that flooded my mind made me feel like I was back in time, experiencing the joy and wonder of childhood all over again.Overall, Barbie the Movie was a pleasure to watch. The imagination and creativity that went into the scene and set construction were seamlessly free-flowing throughout the film. The shocking colors and playful designs were a delight to see and made for an unforgettable movie experience.......\",\n",
              "  'From a far, I can see why people would absolutely hate this movie. Just the concept of \"Barbie: The Movie\" is enough to make people feel like the art of cinema has been compromised by corporate America. But, as a whole, this movie was very well received. It made over a billion dollars at the box-office and was nominated for 8 Oscars including \"Best Picture\", so clearly it some people really liked it.There is a lot to enjoy in this film. The movie does a good job with poking fun at the Barbie brand without it feeling too much like a spoof. This is a comedy, so the fact that the film is really funny is kind of an important element. Understandably comedy is a subjective thing, so all I can say is for me, I laughed out loud several times through the movie. The movie is clever in how it treats its \"worldbuilding\" and nicely avoids any firm answers about how this world works. Because, yeah, if you think about that sort of stuff in the film there is a LOT that doesn\\'t add up.It is nice that they don\\'t spend too much time in \"the real world\" and focus on the creative fun of \"Barbie World\". The movie is more visually unique and can do more gags when that is the case.When the movie is focusing on being a bizarre comedy, that is when some of the best and most memorable things happen. When it tries to have a more serious message, that is where it loses some momentum. Don\\'t misunderstand me, the movie needs some serious stuff in order to make the comedy work. And the stuff with Ugly Betty and her daughter is good emotional stuff. But towards the end, they realize that Barbie needs to have a character arc and feel like they tack one on last second. There are some very funny jokes towards the end, but it does become a little repetitive and the message feels heavy handed by the 5th time it\\'s brought up. Side note: I wanted a cameo from the voice actress of Barbie, Kelly Sheridan, but she wasn\\'t there.I will emphasize this because Hollywood will learn all the wrong lessons from this movie\\'s success. We do not want a \"Polly Pocket\" movie or an \"Uno\" movie. What made this film a success, beyond its brand or its marketing campaign, is that it was uniquely Greta Gerwig\\'s vision. The movie wasn\\'t concerned with mass audience appeal, it would tell jokes that they thought were funny and hoped others would enjoy as well. If you want to duplicate Barbie\\'s success, give creative people control to make some out there stuff.Wrapped in plastic, it\\'s fantastic.',\n",

As though the writer tried to include little memories or what would be nice rather than a theme or good story throughout. If you have nothing to do worth watching but if you are expecting laughs or a wow factor don't expect too much. I think also instead of directing to children and adults just stick to one or other. Actors were all good but the story just let them down. Hopefully not a trilogy on the way.\",\n",

The jokes were witty, funny, well-written and did not impede on the tone of any serious moments. Barbie was for sure targeted for kids but made for adults to enjoy just as much as the little ones. The casting was phenomenal, every actor embodied their character, Margot Robbie is dynamite in her role delivering every line with sincerity and real feeling. Ryan Gosling was the epitome of Ken, fun, and lovable but he was also able to sublimely deliver emotions that one would not associate with Ken. With 2 powerful stars you would think that the secondary characters would be unnoteworthy, but Simu Liu, and Will Ferrell command the screen so remarkably, not to mention every other Barbie and Ken, and Allen too. All of this without even mention the cinematography and the breathtaking music which culminates into a delightful story that impressively tackles pretty serious issues.',\n",

I wish I could say that was meant to be a compliment, but I found myself trying to figure out where all the pieces fit as the story unraveled.The basic premise seems simple enough and the jokes in the first 30 minutes were pretty funny, but then you introduce \"real world\" characters into the movie after the first act (as shown in the trailer) and it seems to lose its way. Add to that an oversimplification of the male predicament and expected role in society set against an attempt at a nuanced view of the female\\'s expected role and you\\'re left with...mush?Again, it has some decent satire one moment, but then also attempts to show heart the next. One example is how Ken discovers masculinity, but the way a 10 Year old boy might (trucks and horses), yet Barbie sometimes spouts off a simpleton\\'s take on Camus or Neitzche. Honestly, at some points, there\\'s a weird existential dread that flows out of her mouth, but Ken is kind of a moron.Anyone who views men and women like this in real life might have a hard time maintaining long term, meaningful relationships and should probably seek therapy.I wanted to like this more than I could.',\n",

              "  \"Barbie is a good movie. The visuals are nice to look at, the premise is quirky, the dialogues are often witty, it's somewhat self-aware, and even (some of) the songs are pretty great. It made me laugh, it made me smile, and that's great.And yet... it's definitely not a great movie. From what I'd gathered, it's supposed to be a pointed satire that will quickly become a corner stone of gender equality. Instead, it's overly preachy, reductionist, occasionally fails to see the point, and only repeats a message that countless other movies have raised before in much more elaborate manners.The largest problem, though, is the lack of a clear target audience. There are many series and movies that are primarily focused towards children but that can be appreciated by adults as well. Barbie certainly doesn't fit in this regime; I heavily doubt that many children will care about this heavy-handed discussion of an essential adult topic. And yet it is also a bit too silly to properly work as a movie that's targeted at adults.If the movie had come out two decades ago, it would've been brave, and we would be more easily able to forgive it its many flaws. But this is 2023, where women's rights are actively backsliding in large parts of the world, and where the primary issue of gender equality is no longer man vs woman but binary vs pluralistic.Nevertheless, Barbie is a fun movie. Parts of it are fantastic. It's much better than anything we could've expected from a Barbie movie. It just isn't the ultimate social critic it was portrayed as.\",\n",

It appeals to teenagers but also to an older audience. I loved the sense of humor, Mattel was sometimes laughing at themselves too. I found that very nicely done. The acting is amazing. However I liked the first part of the movie more than the second one. It starts to analyze the patriarchy a bit too heavily for my taste. They want to make it clear that this is a feminist movie. They want to clear Barbie's image of the stereotypes she's been associated with for decades: she's not a blonde and skinny perfect bimbo girl. Barbie is a feminist, she represents empowered women. I keep questioning myself about this point of view: little girls have been associating the idea of beauty with Barbie for so long, so my idea of Barbie has been quite the opposite throughout my life. I find it hard to accept it.Now let's talk about Ken. He only exists because Barbie exists. In Barbie Land he counts nothing. There is a deep criticism toward the patriarchy which I can understand but goes slightly too far for my taste...\",\n",

The way they move in the Barbie world, is it children moving them in the real world, and speaking for them? Not-developed. The weird doll, what happened to her, how does she feel? Not-developed.

It's boring, disjointed, and sexist (to both men and women). It's an unwatchable mess, and by the last 20 minutes we cared so little about the characters, that we just left. It's horrendous.

Now, I know that this movie couldn't be marketed in a way that was truthful to the plot because less people would go to watch; people wanted to see a movie about the bright and bubbly character of Barbie, not a Barbie whose whole persoality is a complete 180 from her original. With that being said, I think the message the mvoie was getting at of how people should be free to be who they are and not conform to society's standards, etc is nothing we haven't heard before, which brings up the question of did we really need a movie to tell us this? Another question I have is why did Ken have a song? It didn't benefit the plot but that can be left to your own volition.

It really was very tedious, with much the same scene content played over and over again.The styling was good as was some of the dance routines and stylised doll movements from the cast, but even this got tiresome.The cast tried their best with the material, but to my mind Margot Robbie has done two duff movies in a row, this and Babylon. I am being to think she lacks good judgement and any acting heft.In terms of other reviewers on here, they were watching a different movie and judging the vague thematic material as a plus because it looked at the power dynamic between men and women, forgetting the exploration undertaken in this movie was a historical perspective from the 1960's, when Barbie was invented and really had little application in 2023.In summation it was style over substance, it lacked humour and story and indeed anything memorable. At best this is a 3 outta 10 for the dance sequences.\",\n",

I recommend this movie mainly for adults because it is related to subjects that we experience everyday mixed with nostalgy (I cried twice during the film) and great sense of humor.

Besides it's reputed director, screenwriters, actors, references for great movies and the most popular artists composing it's soundtrack, the movie doesn't crave to be one masterpiece. Its just a regular movie that fulfills its role. Even with some metalanguage and self commentaries, it doesn't reach a self-awareness that makes this worthiest. The same works for it's social commentaries, that use strong words on the dialogues only to cover it's weakness of some social-revolutionary statement of it's own ideology.

              "  'The Barbie movie is a very mixed bag. It tries to appeal to both young girls and adults it seems, but this leads it to be very inconsistent with its humor. Margot Robbie does a fantastic job as Barbie and especially the opening works really well in highlighting the absurdity of Barbie\\'s world, where its houses are all open and have no stairs, and its showers have no water and the fridge is filled with a drawing of groceries. All that works fantastic. But mixed into this is a lot of adult humor and sexual innuendo, which makes for a strange mix. It isn\\'t until after the first act, where the movie tries to be more than just a movie about toys, that it kind of falls apart.The Barbie movie has a lot to say about gender rolls, and that is probably a healthy thing for the audience (even men) to think about. But if you are a male viewer, and if all you took from this movie is that \"it hates men\", then you completely missed the point. The movie critiques the role of men and women in society and it also critiques Barbie dolls and their depiction of what a girl should be. It pokes fun at it, while never completely turning against Barbie as a product. This is a Barbie movie after all. That this toy movie tries to be more than what one might expect out of such a film, is a good thing, including criticizing gender stereotypes. But the execution leaves more to be desired.There is plenty to critique about the Barbie movie that is valid. The Barbie movie tries to do a lot of things, and especially towards the third act it becomes kind of a mess. The movie could have benefited from a bit more focus. Instead, it is all over the place.Just the plot of Barbie and Ken being confronted with the real world, probably would have been enough for a whole movie. But to the movie\\'s credit, it wants to be more than what the audience expects out of a Barbie movie. I would argue, too much.There\\'s the plot of Mattel trying to capture Barbie, with the awkwardness of a Mattel product (what this movie is) critiquing Mattel. It never feels entirely earnest.Then there\\'s the plot of Barbie seeking out the child she belongs to and reconnecting with her. This plot works the best, but it is kind of undermined by everything else that is going on.Then there\\'s the side plot of Barbie meeting her creator, which at first feels like a random easter egg, but then later is brought back again towards the end of the movie, without really fitting in with all the other plots. The Barbie movie is very inconsistent regarding which world is magical and which is not. At first it seems as if Barbie-land is the place that is magical and unrealistic, which during the opening is the source of a lot of humor. Once Barbie and Ken visit the real world, the contrast leads to more humor. But then they start mixing in magical elements in the real world, and things become very messy. Such as Mattel having a mysterious floor where Barbie\\'s deceased creator is still alive. This is later explained away as a haunting with a throw away line, but that doesn\\'t quite explain it either. The movie seems to forget which of the two was the magical world and this ends up undermining the world building. It was a side plot we didn\\'t need in the first place.Then there is the plot of Ken realizing men rule the world and learning traditional male stereotypes, and then bringing all that back to Barbie-land. This plot feels a bit disjointed. It ends up dragging the third act back to Barbie-land, when it feels all that belongs to stay in the first act. Everything with Barbie trying to make the other Barbies remember who they are, and revisiting ugly Barbie, should have been cut. It feels like a whole extra movie tacked onto a movie that already has plenty going on.All in all, it is a bit of a mess storywise. This script could have used a bit more editing. Also, it ends on a joke about Barbie looking forward to her first visit to a gynaecologist, which is a bit of low hanging fruit. When you try so hard to make a movie that has something to say about gender rolls, this is probably not the line should end on. Suddenly the story about a deleted elaborate farting scene makes a lot more sense.As a comedy movie, you can\\'t aim for a high bar story wise, when your movie\\'s comedy is aiming for the lowest bar. It doesn\\'t seem to work.',\n",
              "  '\"Barbie,\" the new movie with a mission to encourage and empower women while challenging the notion of Barbie\\'s objectification, falls short of its ambitious goals due to its overwhelmingly negative portrayal of men and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. While the film\\'s attempt to address social issues and promote self-confidence among girls is commendable, its approach feels one-sided and counterproductive.On the positive side, \"Barbie\" does boast an impressive musical score that complements the storyline effectively. The movie\\'s soundtrack adds a touch of vibrancy and energy, helping to alleviate some of the weight of its problematic themes. Bilie Eilish\\'s song, \"What was i made for\" sang by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling performance in \"I\\'m just Ken\" are the standouts.Unfortunately, the film takes a heavy-handed approach in addressing gender issues. Instead of promoting a message of unity and understanding, \"Barbie\" seems to place the blame for all the problems in the world solely on men and the patriarchy. Such a narrative fosters a divisive atmosphere and fails to acknowledge the importance of cooperation between genders to achieve true progress.The portrayal of men in the movie is disappointing and paints them with an unfairly broad brush. By portraying all male characters as either stupid, childish, immature, or disrespectful towards women, the film perpetuates harmful stereotypes, alienating a significant portion of its potential audience, including male viewers and responsible male role models.Additionally, the excessive focus on harassment, groping, and dirty looks that Barbie experiences when she enters the real world feels gratuitous and does not contribute constructively to the movie\\'s message. Instead of presenting a nuanced and realistic exploration of gender dynamics, it leans heavily on extreme examples, potentially distancing audiences from the central themes the film is attempting to address.',\n",
              "  \"The Barbie movie reminds me a lot of The Lego Movie. Not only do they both feature Will Ferrell, but for ideas that could have easily been been gimmicky and made only to sell toys, they are surprisingly smart, clever, and charming. In the case of this film, the plot is well written and paced. The message starts out as a typical one about feminism, but ends up becoming a rather poignant one about being yourself instead of just a label. And the script is astonishingly really funny. In addition to the abundance of clever nods to everything Barbie that even I, as a guy, recognized at least some of the time, there is no shortage of great, hilarious lines (I still say Mojo Dojo Casa House) and gags, like when Barbie's car flips and spins in the air when Ken startles her.I thought going in that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were far too talented to play Barbie and Ken. So imagine my shock to find they excel in these roles. Not only are they both really funny (especially Gosling), but they also handle the dramatic scenes surprisingly well; you know, considering who they are playing. The rest of the cast is great too, perfectly mixing goofy and over the top with genuinely good acting. It also helps that everyone looks like they're having a great time in every scene.Barbieland looks absolutely fantastic. It's a pink, plastic nightmare made of what I vaguely recognize at times as life sized replicas of actual Barbie playsets, with all the fake plastic props therein, leading to plenty of great sight gags. The costumes that the various Barbies and Kens (and one Allen) wear are all great too, gaudy and ridiculous as ever. In stark contrast, the real world is as drab as you would expect, although the Mattel building has some great designs. Meanwhile, the soundtrack is great, with a solid underscore and some well chosen songs, including original tracks for our two leads. I'm Just Ken is one of the biggest toe tappers of the last few years and I always enjoy watching it.Overall, as someone who was convinced he was going to hate Barbie, I can safely say that I was quite wrong, and happily so. It's funny, smart, and has everything in it for boys, girls, and everone in between. I don't know why this is the IP Hollywood felt the need to put genuine effort into, but I'm glad they did.\",\n",

She thinks about death,her feet are flat and she shows emotions. So she decides to go to weird Barbie (Kate McKennon) for advice and travels to the real world to find her owner Gloria(Ferrara) and her daughter Sasha to find out why she is malfunctioning. But will Barbie choose the real world or the plastic land of Barbie Land?.Overall I actually liked this film .Yes it's very silly and stupid but it was entertaining. Ryan Gosling was hysterical as Ken who is obsessed with horses and prospecy and the other guys as Ken including new Dr Who Ncuti and Secret Invasion star Kingston Ben Adir and Michael Cena as Allan. I guess if I had to change anything it would be for Barbie to stay in the human world more and actually have them as actual Barbie dolls first like Life Size or even Enchanted animated.If you loved Elf(since Will Ferrell stars in both films and the setting mirrors it too) and The Lego Movie along with adding sexual innuendo and woman's rights along with men's rights then you'll enjoy it.

I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity.\",\n",

I grew up playing Barbie's and have watched the animated films many times with my kids.The movie from start to finish is so thoughtfully executed. It's for everyone, but mainly young girls need to see this. It's a great reminder of how special we are as women and how special ALL of us are individually as a person and the life we get to experience.Another fantastic element is adding a very 90s feel to the film. You will laugh like you used to laugh when fun comedies would come out in theatre's years ago. I haven't seen just a good comedy with heart in years.I brought my 7yr old and we dressed up for it too. I wanted her to see me comfortable in my own skin and her as well and the film touches on that. It's suited for any age, regardless of the rating.I don't give high ratings like this to films usually, as I find small things usually that I wish had been addressed more... but not in Barbie. What a fun movie and a great time you'll have watching this in theatre (or at home) knowing it's your childhood come to life.\",\n",
              "  \"I saw Barbie, starring Margot Robbie-Babylon, the Suicide Squad movies; Ryan Gosling-Blade Runner 2049, La La Land; America Ferrera-Superstore_tv, Ugly Betty_tv; Kate McKinnon-SNL_tv, Ghostbusters_2016 and Will Ferrell-Holmes & Watson, the Daddy's Home movies.This is a weird, funny and thought provoking movie about a doll that was created in 1959 by Ruth Handler. Before the movie starts, there are several music videos with singers and stars from the film. The movie then goes straight to Barbie Land, where everything is pink-Barbie's favorite color-and everyone sings and dances a lot. Margot is the main Barbie-there are lots of them, of course, as well as Kens-and Ryan is the main Ken. Everything is going along like usual for Margo until she starts having visions of death and despair. The rest of the Barbies tell her to consult with Kate-the weird Barbie-and Kate tells her that she must go to the real world and find out the source of her problems. Ryan goes with her and they both discover that in the real world, it's not run by Barbies but instead by men. Will plays the CEO of Mattel and America is his secretary. There are messages about feminism and the role of the Barbie doll in shaping little girls' minds-both good and bad-and there are several cameos of actors you may recognize, as Ken and Barbie.It's rated PG-13 for some language and some sexual innuendo-mostly just jokes-and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes.Although I would probably not buy it on DVD, it is entertaining and would be a good one to stream.\",\n",

              "  \"I had trouble following this story. I got the general idea but the dialog seemed to be all over the place. In a nutshell the story is as follows. Barbie senses someone is feeling bad in the real world then leaves Barbieland to try to make the person feel better about themselves. Meanwhile Ken discovers that men have more power in the real world than in Barbieland so when he goes back he rallies the other Ken dolls to take power by force. Meanwhile the Barbie's decide to stand up for themselves and take Barbieland back. Somehow there's some middle ground resolution which didn't seem to make sense. The end. I didn't laugh once so I'm not sure where the comedy aspects were. I was also disappointed when Ken and Barbie broke out into song in the final act. It seems that whenever Hollywood has a bad story then they turn it into a musical. This film was as shallow and one dimensional as a plastic doll who can't bend their knees. The characters were so boring. Nothing much happens and then I was just left waiting for the film to finish. I don't expect this film to win many awards. It was more of an idea than a film with substance. I suppose it's one saving grace was that it's very much in line with American consumerism and patriotic to the 1980's American ideals of beach culture and beauty. The film manages to capitalise and celebrate the bright 1980's fluorescent colour palette that was shovelled at teenage girls in the era, ala slap bands, rollerblades, Alf and fruity loops cereal. However, Barbie as a character seems to be stuck in the 1980's and is really outdated and boring in the 2020's. Some things should be left to age gracefully into history. Especially, a stiff plastic doll without much personality.\",\n",
              "  'Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie. Of course she\\'s incredibly beautiful, talented, funny, and hip; however, I didn\\'t have some life-altering epiphany, like so many others did. I actually thought the film was way too cheesy, 45 minutes too long, and also confusing at times. I love the originality and strong feminist viewpoint, the idea of Ken learning about misogyny and sexism, essentially bringing these twisted ideas to Barbieland, leading all Barbies to succumb to a more subservient role, while ultimately forcing them to rediscover their own power, talents, intelligence, and individuality. But after an hour or so, I kept thinking, \"Why can\\'t Barbie just sing a song?!\" I wanted a fluffier, comedic Barbie, while what I got was a doll having an existential crisis. It was depressing at times. The cast was phenomenal, of course. I just didn\\'t expect it to be such a mess in terms of storytelling.',\n",
              "  'Hello,\\nUpon watching \"Barbie,\" directed by Greta Gerwig, I was immediately struck by the breathtaking visual spectacle the film offers. The vibrant universe and the ensemble cast, led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, transported me through a range of emotions. Robbie, in particular, impressed me with her charisma and depth.The plot of the film, set in the Barbie Land where perfection is the norm, seemed to me a metaphor for our society\\'s relentless need for perfection and the stigmas associated with imperfection. I felt the film raises pertinent questions about gender dynamics, societal norms, and the challenges faced by women, albeit sometimes a tad overtly.Many have lauded the technical aspects of the film, such as the genuine soundstage, impeccable costumes, and memorable musical numbers. However, what stood out the most to me is the film\\'s commitment to pushing boundaries. While the marketing showcased the film as a whimsical take on the iconic doll, \"Barbie\" goes way beyond mere glitter.Like any film that tries to juggle societal commentary and entertainment, \"Barbie\" might not resonate with everyone. However, I view it as a brave attempt that defies norms, much like its main character. Would I recommend it? Absolutely. It\\'s a film that deserves to be seen, if not for its visual splendor, then for its remarkable performances.',\n",

Top-notch, flawless.The context is also interesting; the script is creative, and the story is engaging, making the film much more fluid. Personally that's what I liked the most, how the fantasy and the reality interact. The actors were amazing too, and not only the main characters.Some other human characters were underdeveloped compared to Barbie and Ken, but that was expected.As a man I recon that this is a movie that speaks to women, but also to men sensible to women struggles.

It certainly is different and kind of unique with a pretty wonderful opening along with a fascinating production design, but ya gotta love pink! It's all about feminism and patriarchy and it's a little heavy handed about both of those topics, but it makes its points. While it's not a great film, it took some great talent to make this odd idea work and I am referring specifically to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach who provide some funny and witty moments. In my opinion, both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both too old for their roles, but they pull it off quite well. While it looks and feels like a children's film some of the time since this is about dolls, it's message is for adults, though children would appreciate a lot of it without really getting it, so to speak. It also has some really good choreography and a very nice song by Billie Eilish who I am kind of surprised doesn't appear in this at some point, though Will Ferrell does, which is a shame as he is his usual annoying self, but that's just me.

It doesn't make any sense or advances the plot in some way. I think most people see the movie like me average but still entertaining. So back to my question why are some people, mostly men surprisingly, so obsessed with this movie. Is there a message most of us don't see?

That is the main prompt of the movie, which quickly takes a new turn all together, focusing on Ken and turning the tables on gender and how men and women are presented in films and in art in general (not to mention how their are treated in real world). That social commentary was spot on, under the light of more comical lences that makes it more appetizing and easily digestable. However, the movie does get close to being over preachy, loosing its initial main idea. That could have been solved by making the movie a little longer, giving the plot space to smoothly develop and have all those features handled in a better way. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't have that, thus, the result is an overstuffy, half baked plot.On the other hand, the performances were enjoyable, with Gosling trully shining in this one.

Likewise, in the real world, men control everything and women are just there to look pretty and clean and stuff. The film shows half the human population (the men) as utterly and irredeemably horrible.And by the end you would assume they would compromise and have equal power and respect and everyone would see the value of men and women being both pretty awesome and that they should work together as a team? Nope! The Kens just wither back to the sidelines to their depressing selves while the Barbies go back to their girl-power or ruling everything without thinking twice about it. It feels like they almost had a good ending, but simply just couldn\\'t help themselves.In front of where me and my friends were sitting was this mom and her two daughters who seemed around 5 and 7 and that poor little girl was squirming in her seat and asking \"Is it almost over?\" multiple times to her mom who was trying to quiet her down during another preachy scene.

Only she could look at the plastic empire and find a story about what it means to be a woman in a society that hates them. What's miraculous is she does this all while also proving that men still suffer in an unequal society as well. It's such a careful examination of the culture we live in, but it's also absolutely hysterical and includes some of the hardest laughs I've had at the movies all year.I know Greta's next project is a massive IP blockbuster, and while some might be worried that she's selling out, I'm not.

And after the first 2 minutes, I was already having a bad feeling about this one.....and I really wanted to like it. As expected, much of the movie happens in BarbieLand, a perfect little beach front community where everyone cherishes Barbie. Lots of singing and dancing, colorful scenery, character introductions and so forth. You wonder where the story is going and out of the blue comes the theme of death. So at this point, its no longer a kids movie IMO. And the story developes into Barbie's mission to cross in to the real world to save the person who's not happy with their Barbie doll. And by not happy, I mean depressed with thoughts of death. A pretty dark twist. So the mission begins with Ken and Barbie visiting LA. The story becomes a mix of several themes including female enpowerment, corporate greed and a push for a male dominated society. Although I chuckled a couple times, this movie never sucked me into the story to the point where I felt I wasnt in a theater, if you know what I mean. In fact, it felt like every 15 minutes I was hoping the movie was over. Margot and Ryan give outstanding performances, but the novelty of Barbieland quickly wears off, leaving the audience blasted with bubblegum pop music and watching Barbie disolve into an emotional trainwreck as she faces a personal identity chrisis. Of course, this becomes the stories message to tweens, that life's hard, its OK to fail and finding strength to succeed isnt easy, regardless of gender. Its an awkward movie in that it doesnt really fit for kids or adults, unless you ignore the story and just look at the pictures.\",\n",

In theme, not execution. But it says a lot of quiet parts out loud. What we did with our Barbies. To them. Who is Ken anyway? Why is Ken? What is death and why does it matter? What is motivation and what is success? What is feminism and what is dementia t progress? Honestly. I would have thought you were blowing my horn.

It was better than I was expecting but in my opinion still a little bit over-rated. At almost two hours it was a bit long. The first hour was fun and had me laughing; the second hour - to me at least - started to drag a bit. But it's an enjoyable watch for the most part and leaves me shaking my head at the the right-wing menfolk who seemed to think this movie was the end of civilzation as we know it. That says more about their own sense of masculinity than about the quality of the movie.The cast (Margot Robbie was Barnie and Ryan Gosling was Ken) was likeable and funny. One way of cutting the over-long runtime would have been to cut out most of the scenes involving the fictional Mattel execs. I did not like them, most of their scenes seemed superfluous and it seemed just a way to give Will Ferrell an acting gig.But overall I'd give the movie a solid 7/10.\",\n",
              "  'Summary: This isn\\'t the fun, light-hearted fantasy the marketing would have you believe. It is instead a clunky film that is nearly all social commentary. In fact, the plot and protagonist of the film is the patriarchy and more specifically men. The result is a sexist film that can be good at times but frustrating for many viewers. The movie may even be damaging to woman (explanation below).Full Review:I will justify my summary above but I want to first share that the film has a tremendous amount of potential and that I will be looking forward to a sequel should it come out. The cast is excellent. Gosling absolutely steals the show and is clearly having a ton of fun. Robbie is also a gem and is the quintessential Barbie. They could not have picked a better cast. The set design was fun and probably exactly what you would hope for in a Barbie film. The tempo was great, the cameos were fun, the movie was appropriately self-aware, the humor generally landed well. It\\'s probably not a kids movie and I think that I wouldn\\'t want my kids to attend it do to the adult humor and the social commentary bit. I think that for the right audiences the social commentary might elicit some good discussions and may be interesting to some.I don\\'t mind social commentary but I\\'d prefer to know that its in the film before I go. If I do go see a movie with social commentary its not generally as clunky as the movie Barbie is. For example, after the movie I asked several people what they thought was the message of the movie and no one person had the same answer. Surely the message centers around feminism or woman\\'s empowerment. These are themes that generally everyone can get behind but the movie isn\\'t clear on specifics. Does the movie intend to convey that Barbie is problematic as a doll or symbol? Is the movie suggesting the patriarchy is a problem? Is it that woman can do anything they put their mind to it? Is it saying the diversity is important? Basically... the movie fails to pinpoint what exactly it is trying to comment on.Generally if you go see a movie that is intended to be social commentary then you should come out of it with thought provoking questions and ideas. It should be a movie that \"flips the script\" so that if you are on the opposite side of an issue you become more aware/informed after watching the movie. Unfortunately Barbie doesn\\'t do this. Barbie lives in a fantasy world but the real world n the film is also a fantasy. She doesn\\'t face any real world or realistic dilemma causing us to evaluate the gender systems we have in place. Even the times Barbie is subjected to discrimination or sexism (which is fairly constant) these times are not realistic or believable. Thus the commentary comes off as preachy and anecdotal.Barbie is also not a role model or a hero in the movie. It\\'s weird watching a movie that is written to empower woman while also featuring a weak and sexist female lead. The film begins with Barbie dismissing men and being biased towards woman. I don\\'t want to leave any spoilers but.... SEMI-SPOILER... the movie ends with things being unequal between the sexes. As a result the film almost suggests that the sexes shouldn\\'t be treated equally. In other words, its clear Barbie and Barbie the movie believes females are the superior gender.Moreover, Barbie is not a strong and powerful woman. We are told in the movie that Barbie is an inspiration to woman fairly constantly. Normally I would agree. But the Barbie in this movie is depicted as uncapable and weak. She is egocentric and motivated by a desire to be beautiful. In fact, the entire plot kicks off because she finds cellulite on her legs and it later revolves around her self-centered interests to maintain power in her community. Its hard to relate or feel sympathetic under these circumstances and if anything the plot is an indictment on woman\\'s (and societies) overuse of beauty and sexuality. As Barbie trots along her path she doesn\\'t overcome anything on her own and she doesn\\'t change as a person. In fact, everything she \"accomplishes\" is because someone told her what to do or because someone else did something for her. Not one time can I recall did Barbie accomplish something on her own or reevaluate her positions. By the end of the movie she is still the same problematic Barbie we were first introduced to. This is an interesting problem because it means that Ken, the movie\\'s antagonist is actually the hero of the film. He is the only one in the film that overcomes adversity and is the only one in the film who grows and changes. We don\\'t root for Ken, of course, but if you spend a few minutes thinking about his character arch you will realize he is actually the victim and the hero of the movie. This is what I meant by saying it is a clunky film - it has too many mixed messages, unexplored and unrealistic themes, and watered down but constant social commentary. Then add the fact that the social commentary expressed in the film is of a serious issue but is juxtaposed with a lighthearted comedic tone.Then there is the problem with the movie\\'s portrayal of men and specifically Ken. First, lets acknowledge how woman have been poorly portrayed in past by depicting them as weak and needing men. We can agree its inappropriate - so its confusing as to why the film does the same thing, except to men. Ken is portrayed as inferior to Barbie in every way when the appropriate thing to do would be highlight the strengths in both genders. A counter argument people may make is, \"Dude, its just a movie about a doll and its a fantasy land.\" I get it, its not real. But the problem is the movie depicts men as inferior and stupid in both the fantasy and real world. In fact, there is little distinction between the men in both worlds. On the other hand, the woman in the real world are depicted more genuinely and certainly more intelligently. This leads me to conclude that the writers likely do have a problem with men even if they were trying to be humorous. In fact, there is a whole subplot with an all male corporate board that seems to be a non-sequitur. It seems its only purpose in the film was to dump on men or, in the alternative, the whole subplot was intended to be something intelligent but ended up being too poorly conceived to be meaningful in any way.So, I have to say the film is disappointing and problematic in so many ways. But the potential is huge. I would look forward to a sequel but they have to drop the social commentary or, in the alternative, make a more cohesive movie with less mixed signals. Barbie should demonstrate why she is so amazing and earn her place at the top. We don\\'t see why she is special or see her become the hero in her own movie. I expected to see a movie about a powerful woman who also likes to have fun. What I got instead was a bait and switch.',\n",

Contrary to what some people are already claiming, this is not a men hating film, it is so much nuanced than that. In fact, by the film's conclusion it is clearly demonstrated why extremes wouldn't work, we all need each other and we need to learn how to coexist. I'm so glad this film had something to say. I can tell a certain faction of pea-brained individuals are absolutely gonna seethe when they see this film, and that just make me love it even more. I can't believe a movie like this got such a huge budget and is such a success.\",\n",
              "  'Greta Gerwig\\'s mildly sly take on the doll myth works more on the margins than directly. Here, a \"Stereotypical Barbie\" (Margot Robbie) and a seemingly stock Ken (Ryan Gosling), end up questioning the standard Barbie myth.Of course, when it\\'s a $150M feature (with an equal amount for advertising) based on a mega-brand toy, one can\\'t expect a truly subversive film. Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach mostly settle for some gentle barbs and lots of winks and nods right from the pre-credits sequence. The screenplay takes elements of Toy Story/Lego Movie, Stepford Wives/Don\\'t Worry Darling/Get Out and the Pinocchio legend to tell it\\'s tale. Most of the funnier bits are the asides.The most enjoyable aspect here is the candy-colored Barbie-land designed by Sarah Greenwood, outfitted by Jacqueline Durran and photographed by Rodrigo Prieto. The assortment of other Barbies and Kens including Alexandra Shipp, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae along with Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, John Cena and more also bring wide-eyed joy to their roles. Michael Cena is amusing as the Non-Ken, Allan.Less successful is the \"real world\" with the exception of America Ferrera and Ariana Greenblatt as a mother and daughter, and, most especially, Rhea Perlman as Ruth (although the movie fails to mention that she was not only a tax cheat, but also stole Barbie from a German doll). Curiously, once they enter Barbie-land, Greenblatt\\'s Sasha loses much of her real-world bite. More damaging are Will Farrell and his hench-men from the Mattel corporation. They are simply low rent buffoons who add little save for padding out the running time. Occasionally, one is reminded of all those lesser SNL based films where a decent sketch is stretched out to feature length. It\\'s clever if too on the nose and obvious most of the time. Nothing exemplifies this as Ferrera\\'s monologue about how it\\'s \"impossible to be a woman.\" It\\'s well written and beautifully delivered by the actress, but, it feels out of place in a movie where the wittiest and sharpest material up until then have been half-whispered digressions, winks and nods. It\\'s the one time the subtext takes center stage and it sticks out all the more because of that.The ending is rather sweet. BARBIE is about as good as one could reasonably expect from a studio concoction with Gerwig et al. Delivering an enjoyable lite entertainment.',\n",

As a woman, a teacher and a mom, I was happy that Mattel took this step toward addressing the \"stereotypical\" image of Barbie which is said to have impacted how young girls have judged themselves for many years.Throughout the recent years, you would see Barbies of various races, but (to my knowledge) always skinny, with pointy feet, fashionable (mostly rather revealing) clothes and a face full of make-up.So, yes, it remains a question to be answered, but this movie didn\\'t seem like it covered it all.For example, the film starts with reminding us that pre-Barbie, little girls played with \"baby dolls\", not an adult, make-up wearing, fashionably-clothed Barbie.This question is never addressed in the film again.Even for teens and adults, this film seems like it has so many great ideas, but it doesn\\'t know where it\\'s going.Plotline seemed a bit convoluted to me.Lastly, I hope that making this movie was not an effort by Mattel to sell more Barbies.',\n",

Michael Cera was absolutely hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing at the broken barbie, played by Kate McKinnon.Nevertheless, although it was clear they were trying to exaggerate the message on purpose, I found the plot to be just.. stupid. Barbie fights the patriarchy, or, Ken on a horse. I found the humour during multiple points in the movie to be dry, especially stressing how much Ken loves horses.The ending, I found to be mushy. I was expecting something better, and just kind of felt let down. Almost like it was lazy.In conclusion, I'd give this movie a solid six out of ten. It's kind of sad, as I am the targeted audience for this film- a young, feminist, progressive woman. Don't get me wrong, this movie was great at parts- but, in the end, was definitely overhyped.\",\n",

              "  'With Barbie, we embark on a journey that feels oddly reminiscent of the \"Legally Blonde\" series. While the movie is fun and aims to champion the empowerment of women, it somewhat stumbles on the path of originality.Greta Gerwig, the director, rather gratuitously employs an iconic character, and it\\'s hard to shake off the feeling that we\\'ve been here before. The film\\'s attempt to convey a message about empowerment is evident, but it leans on well-trodden ground. In doing so, Barbie risks oversimplification and perhaps even underestimates the intelligence of its audience, particularly young women.It\\'s undeniably an enjoyable watch, sprinkled with moments of humor and amusement. However, in the grand scheme of filmmaking, it doesn\\'t quite etch itself as a milestone. In the realm of female empowerment, we\\'re at a stage where narratives should be as diverse and complex as the women they aim to celebrate.Barbie, while entertaining, missed the opportunity to break new ground. The reliance on a very simple movie formula might resonate with some, but it leaves others yearning for a more profound and innovative exploration of what it truly means to empower women on the big screen.In a cinematic landscape that craves originality and depth, Barbie\\'s attempt is a step in the right direction but falls short of being a transformative force in the portrayal of female empowerment. As we navigate the evolving narratives of women in film, there\\'s an expectation for stories that break away from the conventional, offering a richer and more nuanced perspective.',\n",

The movie said Patriarchy more than it said Barbie and completely dumbed men down just to make the women look better.

So she decides to head to the 'real world' with Ken because we've got everything sorted over here right?The film highlights the paradox that is Barbie... and owns it. It would seem that they wrote a pros and cons list and tackled every item on it. Was Barbie an astronaut before women were allowed credit cards? Yes. Has she perpetuated unachievable body image stereotypes? Yes. Do they address both of these issues and everything in between - 100%. Even Mattel, the makers of Barbie and this film, aren't safe, poking fun at their own lack of diversity hiring.The experience feels very intimate, getting up close with Margot Robbie. From the literal extreme close ups to the emotion she manages to give when bringing a kids toy to life. Robbie commits to the role but never comes across as ditzy or dumb, growing more with every scene.However Ryan Gosling doesn't shift out of cheeseball mode but clearly relishes the chance to ham it up as a Himbo.The narration from Helen Mirren, although brief, is one of the highlights. Punctuating moments with her dry British wit.The message of inequality is prevalent in every line of this film and although it's an extremely important message, it could have been done without bashing you over the head with it for 2 hours.Mums and Dads will love the nostalgia and the occasional double entendre. Girls and boys will have fun while hopefully absorbing her (not so subtle) message.By Nick\\n@WatchItWombat.\",\n",

The room changes from lighthearted laughter, excitement, and anticipation to a tension one can sense easily. Our fun and bubbly Barbie soon begins to experience those all too cliche, hashed-out stereotypical mantras as she becomes an empowered woman. Sprinkled throughout are moments of goodness especially from Ryan Gosling and the soundtrack is killer as well.

The Kens dancing as well as all the horses brought tears to my eyes.

Some of the songs were really great and the camera work was really good as well. I wish the story felt a little more connected overall. The tone really shifted around a bunch of times and it got a bit distracting.

              "  'One of the most affectionately crafted and truly hilarious films of all time!Usually, a slight exhale through my nose is enough for me to classify a movie as funny but \\'Barbie\\' had me laughing loud enough to annoy the whole cinema. It was jam-packed with line after line after line of hilarity - I couldn\\'t even get a chance to catch my breath! Greta Gerwig\\'s script had me snorting and crying from laughter, especially when paired with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling\\'s flawless delivery of it.\\'Barbie\\' was full of such in-touch and specific references that the whole audience could relate to. From the Kens mansplaining \\'The Godfather\\' to the inclusion of Weird Barbie who\\'d been \"played with too hard\", Gerwig made the film feel highly personal, which is quite a feat considering the impersonal nature of the subject of the movie.But it was more than just a comedy; the film touched on much deeper themes of feminism and existentialism. When Barbie left the matriarchy of Barbie Land and entered the Real World, the film acted as a political and social commentary on issues surrounding misogyny and womanhood. With Gerwig\\'s depiction of not only what it means to be a woman, but also what it means to be human, she beautifully and skillfully brought the humanity to a plastic doll.The set design, casting, acting, writing and directing were all executed phenomenally and came together to create a poignant, multifaceted and rollicking movie. In Ken\\'s wise words, it absolutely was \"sublime\"!',\n",
              "  'Male loneliness is directly tied to the high value that we give to romantic relationships, as it tends undervalue any other form of love. It results in a current (and big) social problem: straight men who have zero valuable, deep and intimate relationships with people other than their girlfriends or wives. Men depend on women as a source for happiness through romantic love. That\\'s why many straight men have no identity other than being a boyfriend, a husband, a provider.Ken and Barbie had to enter the real world to realize this, among more important and focal problems related to feminity and the place of women in society (which were precise but I don\\'t write about because, as a cisgender man, I think is more valuable if I talk about masculinity and male problems). They question their identity and Ken realizes he doesn\\'t know himself or his place if he doesn\\'t have Barbie by his side.This is not something that I see discussed much in commercial cinema, so I\\'m glad it was and that\\'s why I focus only in that subject in this review, because it was my favorite message related to the male characters. With the rest of the movie there are many things that could\\'ve been done better, such as the self critique/parody and the meta-irony, but the good elements surpassed the negatives ones in my opinion. It\\'s a fun movie, it\\'s very simple, but you know, sometimes less is more (and I think it\\'s better that way in Barbie).It\\'s not the movie of the year and it\\'s definitely not Gerwig\\'s best or deeper film, but it\\'s worth noticing the biggest commercial flick of the year to be a sort-of gender issues 101 to people who might haven\\'t even question their gendered role in today\\'s society beyond \"men work, women shelter and that\\'s screwed up\". It\\'s as feminist as a Hollywood commercial film can be.My favorite Barbie is Hari Nef\\'s Doctor Barbie.',\n",

I expected some silly, fun movie, something like the Lego Movie. I was wrong.The movie initially piqued my interest with its interesting depiction of cartoon behavior in live action. If you've seen the movie, you know what I mean. Interesting, for sure, but not groundbreaking. It slowly progressed and eventually had my full attention. It was something of a spiritual experience for me. The perfect humor drew me in, and the pure emotion portrayed at the end of the movie left me very touched and contemplative.

The diolouge isn't best but it's a movie about barbie what were any of us really expecting.It was kinda confusing towards the end. The begininng was really fun- maybe a little bit annoying but that's just me, like i said, not my type of film. The colors were great, the barbieland set was cute. After they got back from the real world it kinda fell apart for me. I thought they were gonna go a wholeeeee different route than the ken patriarchy taking over? Then the barbies make them fight eachother and make up? And everythings fine? They tried to make it deep and meaningful but it flatlined along the way. It seems like the whole build up was leading to the monolouge scene. I feel the feminist point of the film would've come across better if it was introduced over time instead of having a few blatent comments here and there and then BOOM big monolouge. It was just a lot, but empty at the same time.And i get what they were trying to do in the real world with having barbie be constantly catcalled but that also got to be a lot i think. Like, point proven, all women have had that happen to them. It was a bit overdone and got a little uncomfy.And nothing was ever really resolved in the real world? Besides the mom and daughter with barbie. And then at the end you think barbies getting a job at mattel, first female ceo, feminism, but no she's just going to the gynocologist. Yeah it was a funny and unexpected moment but they had a chance to do something and they didn't take it.Overall much different than expected. This dealt with more serious subjects and got way deeper into patriarchal ideas than i was prepared for. Thought it was going to be lighthearted!So, idk.

The animated world of Barbie is brought to life with bright colors, elaborate sets, and a wide array of characters, all of which are sure to captivate young viewers. The film's commitment to creating a visually stimulating environment is evident throughout.The film's protagonist, Barbie, is portrayed as a strong and determined character, encouraging themes of empowerment and self-confidence for young girls, which is a commendable aspect of the movie's messaging. The voice acting, led by the talented Margot Robbie as Barbie, is well-executed, bringing energy and charisma to the characters.However, the film's narrative feels somewhat formulaic and predictable. While it's understandable that children's movies often adhere to certain storytelling conventions, this one doesn't bring much novelty to the table. The plot follows a predictable trajectory, and the conflicts and resolutions are easily foreseen.Additionally, the humor in the film may not resonate as strongly with adult audiences, lacking the clever wit and multi-layered jokes that make family films enjoyable for viewers of all ages. This can limit the movie's appeal beyond its primary demographic.The soundtrack and musical numbers are catchy and fun, contributing to the film's overall lively atmosphere. These moments, along with the film's positive messages of friendship and self-acceptance, are highlights that provide genuine charm.In conclusion, the 2023 Barbie movie fulfills its intended purpose of entertaining and inspiring young audiences, particularly those who are fans of the iconic doll. Its visual design, positive messaging, and enthusiastic voice acting are commendable. However, it falls short of achieving wider appeal due to its predictable plot and humor that may not resonate with older viewers, resulting in a 6/10 rating.\",\n",

Gerwig\\'s take on childhood and the patriarchy and feminism and love and death resonated throughout the film, adding an extra layer of depth and thought-provoking themes.

The cast delivered stunning performances: America Ferrera gave a deeply moving speech, and Ryan Gosling\\'s performance stole the show, proving many, myself included, wrong about his suitability for the role.Lastly, I must mention Margot Robbie, who was simply stunning and the perfect fit for Barbie.

I liked the shock at seeing how much of a man's world we live in.Negatives: I found the endless cameos and useless one liners really odd.

For me, I expected when the barbies got their homes back they'd then start a new way of life where they share with the Kens. Instead of going straight back to female only or female led spaces.

So they've not learnt from the events that have happened.As well as the montage section I really didn't get that bit and I'm a 33yo female.Maybe I set my expectations too high from all the hype.

Interesting concept, had potential, but later in the movie, it definitely started to fall flat for me.Ryan Gosling definitely held this movie together for me, without the laughs he gave me, it would've definitely been lower than 6/10. I think there was just too much of a push to bring politics into the movie. Some is fine, but it enveloped the movie entirely by the end. Whether or not any of the political stuff was accurate, it felt forced and out of place.\",\n",
              "  \"This movie was so absurd and so fun! I laughed so hard my face hurt. I see people feeling like this movie concluded that women are better than men, but the lesson was to celebrate womanhood in all its forms, with the overarching message for everyone being to find who you are on your own. Barbie told ken he should stand in his own light and find out who he is outside of his relationship with her! He's kEnough!!! I think because this was such a big budget and highly publicized movie, people don't super know who greta gerwig is and how her past movies have really celebrated womanhood through all its phases, especially the messy parts. It was so fantastic and so nuanced and self aware, i'm grateful this movie exists! P.s. If ur mad that the barbies didn't give the kens true parity and just threw some lower level judge position at them, then wait until you find about what the supreme court in the real world does!!!!\",\n",

I just feel like that scene was kind of random and odd I guess. I still enjoy the film overall it was very visually appealing. Will ferrells character was just cheap laughs, nothing new for him. He's too childlike to believe he intends any ill will for barbie so it really takes the wind out of the movies sails. Also the parallels between this and don't worry darling and they have the same flaw in my opinion. An unclear driving force of why this is happening now - randomly thinking about death? I would have preferred to have seen her be picked up in the real world and then the reveal that it was gloria and not the daughter could have been a more significant moment and they could have fleshed out Gloria's yearning for girlhood more and why she played with the dolls.\",\n",

Not even close, waste of my time and a waste of my life which I can never get back.I'll admit I did laugh at one point however I am not sure if this was due to my sanity slowly slipping away or my braincells seeping from my ear drums.

I would not be surprised if the movie wins an Academy Award for at least the set design. Ryan Gosling is very funny as the underrated Ken and Margot Robbie is very well suited to play the iconic doll. A very good commentary on how, sometimes, the Real World works. The story was, at times, very touching, but it's mostly a really good time. I loved it!!\",\n",
              "  \"The 1968 picture Planet of the Apes reverses traditional roles. After time-travelling thousands of years into the future, astronaut Charlton Heston discovers a world where apes are the advanced primate, and humans their chattels.I hated the movie as a boy, in as good a way as it is possible to hate a film. Could it happen, I wondered, where humans could become inferior to another species? If it did, would we deserve it? The film haunted me enough at age 13 to ensure I have never dared rewatch it.The 2023 movie Barbie looks nothing like Planet of the Apes. Its cinematography is an exercise in high-octane kitsch, as unapologetically saccharine and unrealistic as the dolls it is designed to sell. Yet it too explores role reversal, here between sexes rather than species.Barbieland is a quasi-mirror image of Realworld, the film's moniker for present-day California. Barbieland is a gynocracy and a matriarchy. The Barbies, for they are multiple, live happy, fulfilled lives. They prosper at the top of every profession and public office. They never age, bodily imperfections are impossible, and life is a perpetual merry-go-round of choreographed parties, infinite outfit changes and enduring sisterhood. The men - the Kens - are decoration. They are unable to perform even basic functions: physical and sexual. They lack genitals. Their muscles are impressive but purely for show. They preen on the beach, but surfing is beyond them.One day, Classic Barbie (Margot Robbie) awakens to discover her pristine feet no longer arch perfectly into her high-heeled shoes. She no longer walks on immaculately pedicured tiptoes, but on flat, ordinary, soles, to the collective horror of her sisterhood.Robbie realises something is wrong, and - following a revelation from her compatriot Weird Barbie - sets out to Realworld to resolve it. Classic Ken (Ryan Gosling) stows away in her car. The duo eventually arrive in Santa Monica via a series of rose-tinted vehicles.It isn't long before Gosling discovers that Realworld is unlike Barbieworld. Here, the power is held by men. Gosling, surprised to be treated with respect, becomes fascinated with patriarchy, and quickly warms to the paradigm. For Robbie, the experience is the opposite. People mock her. Daily life is threatening, not fun. Her self-confidence warps into self-consciousness. Ken precedes her return to Barbieland, and quickly sets about transforming the pink paradise into Kendom, a toyish grotesque of Realworld, where the Kens are in charge, and the Barbies retained as ornamental servants.Much ensues. We race and chase SUVs with the mother-and-daughter pair who own Robbie's doll in Realworld. There's an overlong musical sequence, in which Gosling reprises his singing and dancing shift in La La Land. Mattel's all-male c-suite, led by the one-dimensional Will Ferrell, provide limited laughs, and add little to the plot, beyond an admirable modicum of self-awareness. Products are placed - even Chanel! - with abandon. Still, we are being entertained and, mostly, engaged.The final act sees Barbie and friends manipulate the Kens and prevail. There are no suffragers in Barbieland and, following a unanimous referendum of an all-female electorate, the natural order of things is restored. A dark, compelling, twist looks imminent, but it never arrives.Rather than lean into the exquisite role reversal narrative, director Greta Gerwig retreats from it. Instead of pressing her male audience to consider how they would like it if what patriarchal societies do to women was done to them, her finale ploughs a much shallower furrow into well-trodden ideas about the link between mortality and existentialism: 'I die, therefore I am.'Robbie's Barbie eventually opts not to live in Barbieworld, but as a real, imperfect woman in Los Angeles. This is not apparently because she hates what counterrevolutionary Barbieworld might itself become, but because she likes the idea of being human. How do the remaining Barbies perceive their homeland? Do they support gynocracy? Are they comfortable with the Kens being sidelined? The passive ambiguity here is uncharacteristic of a screenplay that, for the first 85 minutes, hammers home its message relentlessly and precisely.The narrator (Helen Mirren) assures us that one day the Kens might enjoy the same status in Barbieworld that women do in Realworld. It is hard to see even that unambitious prospectus being realised, given the Kens are gainlessly employed, politically disenfranchised and allowed to hold only junior roles in the judiciary. Barbie and Ken experience equality in neither Barbieworld nor Realworld: in both realms one sex is always subservient to the other. Perhaps Barbie ultimately prefers LA because, despite its manifold flaws, it at least has no pretence to being a utopia.In Planet of the Apes, we discover, in the final reel, that Heston's destination is not a dystopian otherworld, but Earth itself. Through nuclear war, man's hatred, greed, and hubris has caused his own downfall. The oppressor has become the oppressed; perhaps man deserves it? In Barbie, Gerwig avoids such a subversive conclusion. Instead, she ends with the weakest element of a thoughtful movie: a syrupy anticlimax more predictable of Hollywood, and Mattel.\",\n",

It was comedic, touching, educational, ground breaking.It touches upon feminism, misogyny, patriarchy, women\\'s relationship with themselves.It showed a utopia run by women, Barbie land wasn\\'t perfect, the kens were ignored but not hated, undervalued but not sexualized.In a world meant to mirror patriarchy, we saw a difference in treatment that really opened people\\'s eyes.It also highlighted how the patriarchy is toxic to all involved including men, it touched on the lack of emotional intelligence men have, it highlighted toxic masculinity and overall critique of how men and women have been interacting with each other since the beginning of time.The hardest thing about watching this movie is knowing that there will be a group of people who interpret this as \"hate\" when it couldn\\'t be further from the truth and the audience who rejects the messages this film shows are the group of people who need this education the most.The best part of this movie was seeing women of all ages come to the movie theater to laugh, cry and wake up mentally, together.Overall this movie shows the struggle of women and girlhood in a patriarchal society and how it not only demeans women but strips men of their validity, forcing men to grow up disconnected from their emotions and experiences of others and how important it is to bridge the gap between genders to create a BETTER world not just for women but for men as well.This film is truly for everyone and powerful enough to change the trajectory of society. Fantastic film.',\n",

It is not just a rich story in which the message sort of developes.A very long essay would be required to pick apart all the nuances of its manifesto and its plot. While charming on the visual and cinematic level, as an intellectual experience, I'll just suffice to say that this was poorly thought through.They're pro-feminist and pro-individualist and ultimately use barbie as an icon of empowerment and diversity so this movie is basically right in principle.Now I had something cleverish worked out, what was it...Oh yeah. I thought that while trying to be postmodern and meta-referential they strangely lacked self-awareness.They seemed to want to make you think about stuff and yet you CANNOT over-think this movie and its plot except to ridicule it.That teenager is really obnoxious but she's supposed to be.The real protagonist is Ken and I that for the third act I had to meet this movie two thirds of the way for any of it to feel like reasonable conflict.Margot Robbie was miscast. She just doesn't feel like a Barbie.Their concept of the Barbie world was half-baked too. I got the impression that how their toy counter-parts are played with in the real world affect them in the Barbie world, in fact, it's a major plot point. Yet...it seems that our world does not affect the barbies at all unless it is strictly necessary for the plot.I think this idea, not just a Barbie movie but one used to take a post-modern sledgehammer to gender and sexuality, was a movie that needed to be made but should have been given to a different screen-writer.Direction is good though, just the wrong person behind the type-writer.\",\n",

I'd say that these topics are intentionally depicted with a child-like mindset and it may take a while to wrap our adult heads around such approach.Despite this, thanks to the vibrant cinematography, over-the-top social commentary, skillful direction, and great performances (Gosling as Ken rules), Barbie manages to entertain, albeit in a somewhat absurd way.Nevertheless, I expected more from it.\",\n",

Yes!Form the trailers, i never got a solid idea what Barbie the film was: a musical, a comedy, a coming of age story, a metaphor for something greater ? Maybe Barbie tries all of the above to a shallow extend. There are deep ideas introduced that immediately caught my attention. Several in fact, scattered strategically at the beginning, middle, and close to the end. The thing is that those ideas are never fully developed and some even forgotten. The film's comedy is delivered in pastels, pink jokes that rarely made me laugh.Strangely, the film aesthetic, which is pastels, is not quite fully realized either: or pushed to its full vibrancy like in a WES ANDERSON film. The jokes are bland neither too sophisticated for adults to get them, or charmingly innocent for kids to enjoy them.Margo does a good job as Barbie, but is good good enough for a leading role where the fantasy was being sold to me? Honestly, I never actually believed it. Margo never looks like Barbie herself , aside the colors and the imposed name. She did what she could, but I never got the fantasy of Barbie. I believed Reese whiterspoon in legally blonde to be more Barbie like than Margo Robbie herself.The film has great refreshing moments like America ferrera's scenes , full of vigorous lines and life. Also, Ryan gosling gives an excellent portrayal of a ken with an existential crisis. The ending dancing number: fun and amazing. That number alone could potentially go for award nominations.Would I recommend the film to fans of Barbie, yes. Would I personally sit through to watch it again, no.All and all, I walked away the theater not knowing for sure what Barbie the movie was. It is the weakest project artistically speaking from Greta gerwig. In Barbie, Greta's magic and quirky comedic take on life is muddle among so many different things thrown together; it looses the comedy of Frances ha, and the driving force of nature that is lady bird.\",\n",

This movie could\\'ve provided a compelling argument for unifying the sexes, or how men and women complement each other, but NO. Instead in the final act, it chooses sides. And the side is comes down squarely on is the antagonist side, the \"equity\" side. The side of \"well, do unto others as you FEEL (in your hyper-oppressed feeling state) they\\'ve done unto you.\" You feel like the Kens have done you wrong, so you oppress them in return. Never mind the Barbies oppressed the Kens for the entire time before the time period of the movie, and the entirety of the first act. But no, the Kens get out of line for the second act so they must pay. Equity demands retribution, so all men, excuse me, Kens, must pay.While I laughed and enjoyed the first two acts, in the end I felt thoroughly disappointed, angry, nauseated. If they had finished the movie as brilliantly as it began it would\\'ve been a 10/10, but they couldn\\'t resist making it propaganda. I guess the joke\\'s on me for taking our girls to it.Also, there\\'s a monologue in the third act which could\\'ve been BRILLIANT, if the writers had been enlightened enough to recognize that that is how ALL HUMANS feel (not just women, men too). Every man I\\'ve ever known has feel the weight of crushing expectations from society, from women, from other men. It\\'s not just a woman thing.Oh and then the last 5-10 minutes or so were... almost like a different movie.

I'm not the target audience (being a 17 year old guy), but also... who WAS the target audience? It feels like it should be for kids, but it was far too existential for that, especially at the end, and some of the jokes were just blatantly sexual.

It was still enjoyable, but I wouldn't recommend it for small children or even children at all, really.I feel like I have to be careful saying this, but the message of the film was a bit over the top. I understand it and I liked that it was there, but it felt a bit crammed down our throats. It almost feels like a caricature of our own world at times. The real world sucks, but the divide between men and women isn't THAT pronounced - not all men are incompetent, macho freaks who have everything handed to them on a silver platter, and not all women are suppressed as intensely as the film seems to suggest.

              "  \"Barbie (2023) :\\nMovie Review -Barbie Review: Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie is a breezy, funny, pinky, and girly Ride Into Barbieland. These four soft adjectives are enough to describe the Barbie movie. Greta Gerwig takes us into Barbie land with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling to deliver a possible fantasy that we all dreamed of as children or as adults. Being a boy, I couldn't have a Barbie doll in my childhood, but I did have a close look at her with my female cousins playing with her, doing make-up, dress-up, and all the girly stuff. And I don't think any boy is unaware of Barbie and Ken, even if he hasn't played with them in childhood. It's a fascination for us and a dream come true for girls. I am not at all hesitant to admit that if I were a girl, I would have enjoyed this movie more than I actually did as a boy. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it, and that's more than enough for today's social media gender ego system.Barbie begins with the inception of Barbie and how she appeared on earth (if we call it that in this fantasy movie). This very scene is a lot of fun when you see Margot Robbie appearing in black and white checks in one piece and little girls breaking their dolls into pieces. Soon, we are transported into Barbie Land, where all Barbies are living happily. All the women are self-confident, working in top positions, successful, and enjoying life to the fullest, while all Kens are jobless and do nothing but try to mingle with barbies. Our stereotypical Barbie (Robbie) suddenly begins to dysfunction and sense the morality of human life. She has to travel to the human world to find out who the child is who is calling her to be there. Obviously, Ken (Gosling) forces his company on her. However, things go wrong for Barbie in the real world, where she realises she is not loved anymore, whereas Ken finds a motto of patriarchy. Ken returns and takes over Barbieland by persuading other Kens and brainwashing the rest of the babies there. Here, distraught Barbie finds Gloria (America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the catalyst of her existential crisis. Gloria began playing with her daughter Sasha's (Ariana Greenblatt) Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Stereotypical Barbie. Gloria restores Barbie, and then they take off on a mission to bring back all Barbies.It's been a while since we have seen a good-budget comedy movie, so Barbie certainly ends the dry spell. I mean, this one is a fun ride from start to end. It may be a little childish-oh, that's a bad word-let's say child-friendly, but it's damn funny. The humour is girlish, yes, but I liked it too. From Zack Snyder, The Godfather, cautionary note on Margot's casting to slapstick one-liners, Barbie is such a colourful comedy. It does not look like an intelligent film; rather, it stages itself as a crazy comedy. That's one of the points I'd say went wrong in the climax. These characters aren't supposed to be smart, but they intend to be when it comes to ending the show. Why? Pixar's Toy Story had the simple but subtle philosophy that a toy should be a toy for a lifetime. It may have many owners, but its job is to stick to them and be loyal, because that's why we humans love them. Barbie challenges this universally accepted theory and goes against the tide. Now, whether it's good or bad, I leave that choice to you since my personal opinion isn't very affirmative about this theory.Barbie was meant to be a career-defining role for Margot Robbie, and she made sure that you'd remember her forever as Barbie. I kept looking for a single frame where she would not look pretty, and I couldn't find it for 110 minutes. I melted, man. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the funniest character in the whole movie. That cute flirting, those reluctant expressions, jealousy, arrogance, and at last self-discovery-this man has lived the character. Kate McKinnon's weird Barbie appears for a short time but serves enough. Other babies, including Issa Rae, Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackay, Dua Lipa, Sharon Rooney, Ana Cruz Kayne, Ritu Arya, and Nicola Coughlan, are all gorgeous. On the other hand, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Scott Evans, Simu Liu, Rob Brydon, Ncuti Gatwa, and John Cena as Kens add fine support. Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, and Will Ferrell pass the time well, while Rhea Perlman's cameo is blasting. The biggest cheer in the Barbie movie came for America Ferrera's monologue, which describes the struggle and victory of feminism. Ariana Greenblatt steals the show in the first, and the rest of the cast has done well.Made on a budget of $145 million, Barbie is a lavish big screen entertainer, as the production design makes sure you feel the fantasy right. Those fakish items could have been excluded, but having them there is kind of fun in itself. Who's to blame? Rodrigo Prieto's camera does the talking with close-ups and long shots of Barbie and Ken. Barbie does not have any loo breaks, courtesy of Nick Houy's superb editing, and the music is lovable. Some people often say that a female director and female lead's pair is something else, and I have to accept that Barbie could have been a lot less underwhelming without Greta Gerwig. This woman has made a world that is so adorable and so rummy. A few flaws are there in the script and the characters, but since we are not discussing an artistic masterpiece of cinema, let's Chuck that discussion. Let's enjoy this pinky and girly entertainer, which is sure to take female audiences by storm and leave a good enough impact on men too. Not to forget, who's writing it.RATING - 6/10*\",\n",
              "  \"This movie is refreshingly intelligent and visually enchanting. The script is quite clever and fun, and get this: there is not one word of profanity. (This just goes to show that a blockbuster movie can be well-written and need not have dozens of f-bombs.) I give it even more bonus points for good actors who don't mumble. I was beginning to think that today's actors had forgotten that diction was a vital tool in their box. How refreshing to hear every word! Though it carries a powerful message about female empowerment, this is not a movie just for women. My husband enjoyed it very much. Young children won't get most of it, but they might enjoy the visuals. Highly recommended.\",\n",
              "  'LIKES:The Setting:\\n-It feels like a Barbie world in real life and captures the energy of the doll in all glory.-Plenty of accessories, the plastic feeling, and the toy like atmosphere with real life people is totally captured and super fun.-The real world is fine and does the job of acting as the second world, but it\\'s really Barbie land that excels in the feeling of Mattel bringing it to life.The Plot\\'s Originality:\\n-Yes, much of it is predictable and familiar, but there is more to it than meets the eye\\n-Barbie\\'s plot is one part comedy, one part discovery, and one part political philosophy that sort of gives you a variety I wasn\\'t expecting.-It may feel a little out there, but points for trying to be different and more advanced than many other stories have attempted.The Acting:\\n-McKinnon may have been used too much, but I loved her in this film for the way her weirdness works for weird Barbie. Quirky, fun, a little bold, but that SNL line delivery that really works for delivering lines.-Rae is fine for when she is on screen. She\\'s got a few dynamics that her monotone delivery works with what you got, but to get top bill/first bill doesn\\'t make sense to me\\n-Ryan Gosling works well int eh roles, and for his direction, a supporting actor role nomination feels good for me. He\\'s clumsy, funny, hardcore silly, and it works for the ridiculous nature and tone of the movie.-And for Margot Robbie, the woman continues to knock the ball out of the park for how amazing she fits the role. She\\'s sparkly, quirky, but has a range that she just brings. Gerwig brought some new elements out in terms of representation thought maybe not the Oscar performance like some call for.The Comedy At Times:\\n-The movie does have general jokes that worked very well for me, well timed moments that were perfect for breaking the moment.-Satire, to a point, was amazing at times at how much fun they had with certain concepts. The design of Barbie dolls that failed, or the fact of fashion drawing eyes, and even certain trends that we love. It was clever, balanced, and had this timing delivery that worked.-Some of the Ken lines were funny, the fact that I was like classic Patrick from SpongeBob was very fun, especially when sometimes paired with one of the other style of jokes.-And Helen Mirren\\'s narration was the funniest component for me. Her dry delivery, the classy sass, and the fact the woman just sells the lines was my favorite part in terms of laughs and wished there had been more.-As such, the comedy did work at times for me.The Pace:\\n-It\\'s two hours long, but for the most part doesn\\'t feel it and that goes to the fun pacing.-Barbie starts out fun, exciting, and pops into the adventure with a lot of energy.-Then that energy sort of stays, but hunkers down a bit, never losing the whimsy, but finding a means to feel entertaining and somewhat engaging.-That is the superior quality of this movie compared to the other big one, that engaging pace and just having fun.The Music:\\n-By far, the music is what works the best for me in this movie and tells so much and brings so much energy in the track list.-The songs from the radio and the past work well, comedic devices that were quite honestly some of the best jokes for me with several of the characters.-Other songs are fun musical numbers that work, dance numbers full of pop vibe, or later a true stage show musical that had the theatrics and jazz of a stage show.-As for the new songs that were made for the movie, they were my favorite. Remixes of Barbie girl, an exposition song and reprise, and a few other numbers just have so much character that it really added points for me in terms of just how much fun Barbie can be.The Message:\\n-There is a very deep message to this movie, and to be honest... I did enjoy this part of Gerwig\\'s writing.-It\\'s deep, has character development and really drives home a lot of social commentary and trends under the microscope about human qualities. I liked how it was built in, and the dialog to embrace it, and just wished this movie had kept that in line with me.DISLIKES:The Fun Vibes Take a Detour:\\n-I just said the pace was good and there was an energy, but... the fun part did take a detour the further you went into the film.-Gerwig is a very \"unique\" writer and once she got her hooks into her political writing, there were times where the first part of the film\\'s fun was lost to very agenda heavy writing.-I t felt a bit forced for me, and I longed for more numbers, a little adventure, and a little less banter/beating the dead horse that the film went.-Throw in the darker aspects of the agenda, and losing that fun at the beginning was not what I would have liked to see for most of the movie.Gerwig\\'s Hyper Agenda\\n-I get this is who she is, but I\\'ve seen movies where that side of her is toned down and we get a much deeper character drama.-But Barbie... Barbie pulls no punches and berates you with very in your face, no holds bar, rather excessive and in some cases insulting humor that I got tired of.-There were times where that line was perfect and the story quality maximized, but most of the movie failed that balance and she did not seem sorry for what I felt was a tad too toxic for my liking.-If you are a fan of this type of hyper writing, then you are in great shape, but for those like me who are tired of movies becoming agenda venting, this movie is going to lose points for being annoying and simplistic and losing the creative spark.The Stupidity:\\n-The movie has a smart writer and so seeing so much ridiculous silliness in one movie to contradict the smart writing didn\\'t accomplish much for me.-Will Ferrell\\'s direction was one of these moments where he was a straight up idiot, saying weird things that were more awkward and uncomfortable than funny for me. His little montage was just really dumb and to the point it stuck out a bit too much.-Meanwhile, Ken\\'s handling was fine being a moron, but Gerwig\\'s political writing sort of didn\\'t do much for me as rather than improving and becoming elevated like his counterpart, sort of grew toxic level stupid.-That excessiveness again just doesn\\'t work when I saw those sparkling moments that show where everything comes together, instead of feeling like an adult version of a Disney Channel Original movie.The Character Usage is odd:\\n-The movie is trying to balance a lot of names and characters and it only works on that half of the time.-Barbie has too many characters, and some of the people I expected to have more time, were limited than I anticipated and quite honestly a political tool.-They do their work, but, it\\'s just missing balance and full use and I think it\\'s relying too much on a sequel and people just happy with being comedic props and line spewers than anything else.The Story Is All Over The Place:\\n-My fellow reviewers are right, it\\'s a weird story and it is all over the place.-This might give it the unique twist, but Barbie\\'s tale is a jumble of lots of different feels and theatrics that sort of work together, but feel messily put together.-One level is like I said fun, bright, and feels like a dance party meets on stage musical that works to an extent.-The second then becomes this dive into the psyche mixed with somehow comedically stupid gimmicks to try and keep entertaining going\\n-Third then goes metaphysical and really deep, and it kind of works, but then goes really odd and sort of trippy, to a way I\\'m still trying to process.-Gerwig\\'s writing is always deeper and more complex, but this might have tried to be a bit too ambitious for its own good for me and felt just so scrambled and very much in your face for plot telling.The VERDICT:\\nBarbie is a venue that I really did have some fun with and was surprised by the unexpected things it had to offer and the clever writing I had hoped would shine in. A geek like me knowing the references, appreciating the pokes to it, and the fun timing of some well-written lines that had me laughing in the theater. I loved the acting, loved the set, and just loved a lot of the vibes of the less agenda writing really worked for me and will appeal to many of the general group. And the music, whew, really loved it and the energy and storytelling it did which was very good for me. But the movie did not appeal to me in that Gerwig seemed to reach too high for being unique and \"elevated\" leading to moments that just don\\'t appeal to a reviewer like me. The detour of fun for very politically heavy writing was probably my least favorite aspect, losing the killer vibes and balanced fun and humor with a very polarized way of thinking was not my cup of tea. In addition the story elements and character usage felt a bit jumbled, scrambled, shallow, and having too many character moments to really show off Gerwig\\'s better writing. Thus, when balancing this out, my score for this movie is that it\\'s a theater worthy film for a lot of groups and dates. The score is:Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy: 7.5-8.0\\nMovie Overall: 6.5-7.0.',\n",
              "  \"Margot Robbie is the best possible choice to play Barbie and Ryan Gosling is terrific as Ken. It's a very interesting story and not one I would automatically expect from a Barbie movie, but I love how it dives deep into the complexities of gender roles. It shows the negative impacts that a society dominated by one certain gender can have (female in Barbie Land and male in the real world) and we see why it's important to try and understand everyone's perspective. I also love how this movie dives into men's mental health with Ken's arc. It's something that gets overlooked in society and I adore how we got to see Ken learn to come to terms with who he is without Barbie and realize that he is enough just being himself. The movie gives a great arc to Barbie as she tries to understand her purpose. She realizes that the world of extreme happiness that she has been raised in isn't what she wants anymore. There are so many beautiful scenes where Barbie experiences the highs and lows of everyday humanity and in the end she chooses that she wants to become a real human. At first she starts off thinking that she's a great role model because she is always happy and positive but learns there are so many complexities to life that she was oblivious to. She becomes prepared to take on the challenge of being a human because she is desperate to feel something real. It's a great story and Greta Gerwig did a brilliant job directing. The set designs are very impressive and lots of shots are very beautiful. The movie is also very funny and the details and references to Barbie as a brand show just how much care was put into this movie. The music is incredible, there are so many songs in here that are great, but Ryan Gosling's performance of I'm Just Ken and Billie Eilish's What Was I Made For are my favorites. They do a great job representing the themes of the movie. If I had some complaints I think sometimes the movie is a bit heavy handed in its messaging and there are a couple of side characters that are a tad annoying but overall Barbie is a success. 8/10.\",\n",
              "  \"This movie, about Barbie who suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence, is a good fantasy movie!I liked the concept, and it reminded me of The Toy Story Quadrilogy (1995-2019). The dolls were living dolls, but they were existing in their own reality separated from ours. The sense of humor were present, and I noticed that this movie was targeted for both children and adults in several ways. Its satire was well used, and it was frequently entertaining throughout the runtime. The attention to details was fantastic because of the script, the action, the minor details, like eating and drinking, and last, but not least: the sets and the effects - every visual element, basically. The characters' behaviors were like they were controlled by kids, but we didn't see the kids' hands or like that. They acted like they were played with, and that was well executed, I think.I think the story was alright. The outer story in the first and third act was good. The beginning contained a great representation of the characters and their story while the ending went deep into the inner story about the foundation of Barbie and how Barbie has affected people before, but also how Barbie should affect us in the right way today. It's all about accepting the life with its positivities and negativities, but also to believe in causes and to put yourself in others' shoes, because that's how to live as a realistic, self-controlled being. The second act is a big part of a movie, and I got mixed feelings about that act in this movie. It had its meanings, but I think much of what happened, especially in Los Angeles, was sometimes messy and unnecessary. It was much small-talk, and I sometimes got the feeling that some scenes dragged the time. Anyway, it didn't ruin the overall experience.In conclusion, this movie delivers an imaginative and entertaining story. The attention to detail, from the script to the visual elements, enhances the overall experience. The movie's satirical approach appeals to both children and adults, making it a delightful watch for diverse audiences. While the outer story is well-crafted, the second act could have benefited from tighter pacing. Nevertheless, the movie's exploration of Barbie's impact on people's lives and the themes of acceptance and empathy are commendable. Despite minor flaws, the movie succeeds in captivating its viewers and encourages us to reflect on our own existence and the importance of understanding others.\",\n",
              "  'The production and the costume design is absolutely wonderful, same goes to the most of the cast. With beautiful attention to detial, uncluding actual cars and houses that we played with.But the message of \"patriarchy is bad\" seemed to be shoved down your throat too aggressively, with the whole thing seeming a bit misguided and hateful toward men, and i dont believe in battling hate with hate. Dont understand me wrong i am a woman in engineering (world dominated by men), but the concept of feminism is not men vs women and what most feminists strive for is not matriarchal, which the barbie word is. Pinning us against each other is not helpful, as we should work together to reach equality, one cannot work without the other. What could be a wonderful message turned confusing and too strong in my taste.',\n",
              "  \"Okay maybe it was a 9.5 because of two flaws: First was the Will Ferrell character and his board that made their point but then became superfluos. Second was that it is definitely not a kids' movie (although maybe they would see things that I didn't - I mean to be fair, the few kids in the theatre were well behaved so perhaps the movie got their full attention as well).But why did I enjoy it? Simply amazing visuals, Margot Robbie looked flawlessly gorgeous and played it perfectly. Ryan Gosling was also brilliant in this. Great music, great pacing and then there was the script. There were a lot of messages in this film that trod a tightrope between pithy, ironic, sarcastic and cliched. But I reckon they just about managed it which, considering the subject matter, was quite an accomplishment. I will need to see it a second time to check whether the messages were balanced and as meaningful as they were meant to be but I hope that women were as upbeat about it as i was. Overall, on an enjoyment level alone, it deserves its high score from me.\",\n",
              "  \"I watched this movie on an IMAX theater in my hometown (Qatif); it's considered a 70MM\\ncinema in our standards.. As everything was vividly pink, that particular experience made my eyes very sore!! Despite that, I can safely\\nsay that the Barbie film is somehow a funny ridiculous film and I would confidently recommend to watch it over watching Nolan masterpiece of garbage (oppenheimer).Is it boring? Mayyyybe but I don't think so.. does it need a 70MM IMAX? The answer is No No and No.. However, I strongly recommend to go and watch it in 70MM IMAX for the following reasons: the acting is acceptable; the plot is extremely silly; nudity and sex are alomst Zerrrro; you will witness different kinds of Barbie e.g. Skinny, overweight Barbie and more..\\nSimply put, it wins the Oscar for the most ridiculous movie of the year. So, stop the hate and go give it a genius try.\",\n",
              "  \"Why didn't I love 'Barbie'? I mean it's a brilliantly shot film. It's got a great Ryan Gosling, a very good Margot Robbie. Its heart is in the right place; its message is a good, politically correct, one. Its pacing is fine. Its not too long. So then, what was wrong?And the answer is (I guess) ... the story. The plot. While it's far from terrible it was also far from great. And - dare I say this? - it was at times confusing. Confusing in that I did not always understand the characters' motives. Why were these dolls thinking what they were thinking, or doing what they were doing? And yes I know we're talking about fantasy here, so we can't be, or shouldn't be, ascribing real human wants and desirers to these ... dolls. But the film's message is directed to humans, as played out through dolls, and so knowing the dolls wants and desires is not completely out of place.Because 'Barbie Dolls' are manufactured in different kinds of outfits (nurse, pilot, soldier) the film's Barbie-Land heroine, the 'Stereotypical Barbie' (Robbie), believes that real women are equally represented in / by human society. When she learns that is not the case, she travels to the 'real-world' to (a) learn more and (b) help out. What follows is a mish-mash of Barbie-Land male dolls (Gosling) awakening to the benefits of the macho life while its female dolls acquiesce to male demands. That is, until they are awakened by the return of Barbie and some real-world friends. And real-world women's-rights lecturing.At least I think that was what was going on. I say that because while watching the film it had nothing resembling this clarity. So I guess, consciously or otherwise, I thought about it afterward and came up with that theory.My way of saying (a) I could very well be wrong and (b) You might come up with an altogether different interpretation.And I guess that's the answer. Clarity or lack of. That's why I didn't love it.\",\n",

The humor surprised me as I laughed multiple times. The cameos were great. The main cast was perfectly cast. Ryan Gosling shined as Ken. I was overall pleased with the movie.I will say that the humor is catered to parents in some aspects. The kids also have humor that they will enjoy. This movie is mainly for preteen/teenagers. Some parents of kids that are 10 years of age or younger may find the movie offensive.Overall, solid movie with a great cast and a good script.

              "  'Greta gerwig does better to feminism than judith butler with this brilliant piece.Margot robbie, ryan gosling, america ferrera they all marvelous in the movie. I believe cillian murphy will get the oscar but gosling is such a good challenge with his portrayal. Also, america ferrera is a good actress but somehow she always plays similar woman portrayals, i wish she would try thriller genre, she has that aura in her. Will ferrell was too much for me, he also plays same characters for such long time.The main message in the movie which \" a woman can do/be whatever/whoever she wants\" is crystal clear. In a much better way than twisting old fairtales to \"girlboss\" movies which does no good to strong womanhood, au contraire, being confusing for girls to be strong/leader in anytime in any circumstances. Feminism is about having uninterrupted free will whether to be a mum or a boss or both and knowing those are all equally valid like when men does exactly the same and stay men enough.',\n",
              "  \"Barbie is a curious film, and I believe that the high expectations of the general public led to its performance being considered average. The film tries to criticize several things at the same time , criticizing how society puts pressure on women and reflections on self-knowledge, besides that, I assume that at some point someone wanted to criticize large corporations, but all of this gets lost in development and becomes confusing and often it's not clear what the movie really wants to be about, maybe focusing on just one thing or working them all properly would be better. Anyway, the film is fun and manages to get some very loud laughs, and unfortunately this script problem persists in situations that just happen without any development or reason, I hope that in a future sequel this is better worked on.\",\n",

Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.\",\n",

Mattel tried so hard to wash its image through out Barbie's redemption that it almost appears cringe. Will Ferrell in the Same Role as he was in Zoolander or so. Finally the male figure is a bad represantation of the worst and stereotypical patriarchy which you could assist to maybe in the 80s. Despite Goslin's brilliant represantation Ken is just a stupid mamma boy without any merit. Robbie is just wonderful.\",\n",

It had such a sweet simple message done so colorfully. Perfect casting. Margot Robbie literally is a doll. And Ryan Gosling is a combination of hot and funny. We wore pink of course and saw some cute outfits. A couple Ken shirts. While we were leaving, still teary eyed, seeing the mothers, daughters, friends and sisters all wearing pink, it was so touching and we thought how lucky they were to be able to watch Barbie for the first time. I still feel emotional hours later thinking about it. Highly recommend.',\n",
              "  '7.5/10\\nFirst of all, I really loved this movie. I think it\\'s fun and entertaining and I really think it\\'s done with a lot a passion for the original material. The references are clever and I couldn\\'t help but smile each time I saw a Barbie I had as a child (specially Midge!! I loved her). It\\'s a very colorful movie and it\\'s so refreshing to see that, specially with all the \"gray\" movies we get nowadays. The characters in Barbie land are fun and innocent, it really captures the joy of a child playing with the dolls even in the way it\\'s filmed, the way the characters and objects move and even the houses are just like the ones you could play with as a child. Plus I really loved Ken and I think Ryan Gosling did a great job, he was hilarious. The Kens shenanigans were the best parts of the movie for me.However this movie could have been an almost perfect movie if it wasn\\'t for the real world parts and the messaging at the end of the movie.First of all, the real world is extremely exaggerated and they were really pushing the political view they had in this part.The scene where a man simply smacks Barbie out of nowhere is very unnecessary and it ruins the beautiful parts were Barbie is trying to feel and understand the real world around her like with the old lady at the bus stop (that part is just perfect and captures the essence of the real and beautiful complexity of real world feelings). More so, the parts with the mother and the teenage daughter could have been way better and I really didn\\'t like them coming to the Barbie world. The \"deprogramming all the barbies\" was too forced for me and I would prefer if Barbie herself did that.Which leads me to the final part, the politics.After seeing the real world \\'patriarchy\", Ken, a character that lived his whole life just to please Barbie and is nothing more than an accessory to her, finally feels appreciated for the first time in his life and brings the patriarchy to his own world because of that. Is he right? No, of course not. But I think it was actually a logical thing for him to do in that moment. And, for me, the movie was going to acknowledge that at the end. But it didn\\'t. I mean, it did a little bit, but not enough in my opinion. It would have been awesome if the Barbies and kens came together at the end and decided to create a better society for both of them. But instead they chose to make a joke that \"the Kens will someday have just as much power as the women in the real world...\" It really missed the point of making Barbie land and lost the opportunity to make an inspiring example for the real world, one that helps the oppressed and makes equal opportunities for both men and women.Anyway, this my review of the movie and in conclusion: Close Kenough to a perfect movie.',\n",

              "  'I like F-Rating movies, to know and understand women, especially the hidden value of feminism around the story scenario, and of course there is no doubt what makes it Grate Gerwig. Although this time, there is no Saoire Ronan in my opinion is the best chemistry between directors and actresses for female films. This work Barbie, comes set in Barbieland\\'s fantasy that depicts the irrational of a woman. The moving plot of the Barbie fantasy world, conflict increases when entering the world of reality, and the ending is resolved according to the maturity of the story, which is a red herring type of plot; what is meant is that the author diverts the audience\\'s minds, as in this film Barbie has to correct flat soles, but it is not the essence of the Basically the director wants to convey the feminine phase, with an amazing fantasy idea, between the difference between the world of reality and the world called Barbieland.I went straight to the point, which was the first time that Barbie, like women in general, felt insecure, she realized that her feet were flat when she stepped on the sand on the beach. This is my favorite scene, because it reminds me of my childhood, when I saw my sister crying because her Barbie doll didn\\'t stand up straight. I got the meaning from that scene, that in real events women often do not suspect their shortcomings in public places, in this film Barbie is a woman\\'s childhood imagination playing with Barbie dolls, thus avoiding damage or defects in a doll. This adds up to Barbie\\'s wish to go to the real world, to repair the soles of her feet, and the plot twist is that there is a childhood human, who has a barbie doll toy in the form of the main character Barbie, played by Margot Robbie. This is as if a woman will try her best to find the best treatment, in order to eliminate physical deficiencies, regardless of the morals contained in her, even though she is Margot Robbie too.The scene between the world of reality and the world of Barbie, in this case my analogy, the world of reality is represented against liberalism, and the world of Barbie is imagined conservatively, this imagination creates matriarchy in the fantasy world of Barbie by feminism, while the opposite of reality, there is control of the world of Barbie by companies acting in a patriarchal manner. Then the scene of an elderly grandmother, namely Ruth, whom Barbie first met, accidentally sat next to Ruth. My intuition at this moment, seeing the happiness of an old woman, whose beauty is faded but full of precious experiences, thinking that beauty can disappear, and that\\'s what Barbie feels when she looks back at Ruth, and also makes Barbie aware of her question about \\'death\\' in the musical scene at the beginning of the film . This is where Barbie\\'s maturity signifies when she returns to Barbieland.So that at the ending point, the message of this film that describes the growth period of a woman, and the slogan \"She\\'s everything. He\\'s just Ken\", I interpret women as creatures that are unpredictable, experience social phenomena that occur, want to try new things until they get their point of freedom, the purpose of life is understanding everything, pride in being a complete woman who is, in expressing herself in a complex environment , especially women who live in a patriarchal environment. Finally, Barbie realized the meaning of girl, mother, grandmother, and chose to act as an independent woman without admiring men, in this case, Ken.Overall, the scenarios that are played are quite fast and do not create unnecessary scenes, the accompaniment of music to pause the audience brings the neatness of cinema that is of theatrical art value, plus sarcasm scripts that contain, in terms of the capture of the ratio of connoisseurs and comedy humor. Regarding production design, without a doubt, maybe I championed this award was obtained by Barbie at the 2024 Oscars, because from that side it really broke marketing, the pink color is like a mandatory costume for anyone who watches. I give Barbie: 7.5/100.',\n",
              "  'If you told me a few years ago that one of the best movies in 2023, and arguably the highest-grossing one is going to be Barbie, I would have laughed and called you crazy. But here we are, and the atmosphere in the theatre felt like a cultural revolution, which can become \"You just had to be there\" moment for the Gen-Zs.Through the medium of this film, Greta Gerwig expresses the frustrations of all women, and at the same time presents a satirical take on patriarchy. The movie praises Barbie for being a feminist icon, but at the same acknowledges it\\'s regressiveness. Ken is basically every man who embodies patriarchal ideals just for being rejected, as he feels accepted in the real world but gets ignored in the Barbieland, which was a stark reflection on how women feel in the real world. At the end, it has a beautiful message for all women.The script is genuinely funny with bucket-load of hilarious moments and lines. Ryan Gosling brings his A-game as Ken, saying that his expressions are hilarious would be an understatement. Ryan has basically understood the assignment. Margot Robbie was basically born to play the role of Barbie, as she fits into the role to a T. You can feel her as she is going through an existential crisis.The set-design and costumes were praiseworthy and clearly deserves an Oscar nod. The costumes of each Barbies and Kens have been designed so beautifully and intricately, that it bears a mention. The buildings in Barbieland have also been created with love and passion for the universe. The architecture of the movie is a visual treat for the audience.The cinematography of the film does a good job of presenting the Barbie with glitz and glitter. It is pink and completely unapologetic about it.The soundtrack is an icing on the cake. \\'I am just Ken\\' is still stuck on my mind, as I am penning down this review. However, I do feel that the supporting cast was wasted, as thsy had very little to do.In conclusion, the movie is a popcorn-muncher but at the same time delivers a heartfelt message which is very important for the world.',\n",
              "  \"Good movie not a great one.My hopes for this movie were not all that high and the little light of hope for me was the fact that Greta Gerwig would be in the directors chair but as I had suspected she was not given 100% control of the film. I guarantee that every single second of this film was signed off by Mattel and you can definitely tell in some spots where they were the final say.Overall the story is ok, the setup is absolutely horrendous but after that the story becomes better and more interesting. The theme of feminism is very obviously woven throughout and does a decent job of bringing some of the issues the women face to life.The greatest achievement is the production and costume design as Barbieland is a very immersive experience but where it falls short are the scenes in the real world which just don't compare.The acting was all around good and had a couple of standouts including Ryan Gosling and America Ferrera. The big surprise was honestly Margot Robbie's performance which was far from the best in the film. Not to say Margot was bad just surprising considering she is the lead.Overall Barbie is good and will definitely get some nods for production and costume design during award season. Greta Gerwig was already a rising star in Hollywood but after taking on a film of this magnitude her phone will be ringing off the hook.\",\n",
              "  \"BarbieDid you grow up playing with Barbie's? If so, you probably know that not everyone likes the idea of Barbie. Some people think Barbie's are harmful to children. Other people love Barbie. This new movie called, Barbie, explores why Barbie could be problematic. Greta Gerwig is the director, previously she directed Little Women. It stars Margot Robbie from Birds of Prey and Suicide Squad, Ryan Gosling from The Notebook and La La Land, Michael Cera from Arrested Development, Helen Mirren, and Rhea Perlman.In 1959, Ruth Handler, the co-founder of the Mattel toy company, created Barbie. She wanted this doll to inspire little girls to dream and know they can be whatever they want. This thought process seems sexist, it leaves out little boys, who also can be whatever they want. The movie will show you that Handler's idea that Barbie will make society better, hasn't worked out as she probably wanted. Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) live in Barbie land, where women are in charge. Barbie needs to travel to the real world, where she discovers men are in charge and she isn't the inspiration she thought she was.Robbie plays two sides of the same character, at first Barbie is very carefree in Barbie land, and oblivious to all societies' problems. When she gets to the real world however, she discovers things seem to be the opposite from where she came from. Not only is Gosling nice to look at but he also will make the audience laugh. Ken has always felt left out of Barbie land, until he travels to the real world with Barbie. Unfortunately, he learns the wrong lesson from capitalism. He finds out men are in charge, and wants that for Barbie land. What his take away should have been however, is that men and women can both hold equal power. Alan (Michael Cera) doesn't have a duplicate, therefore he knew who he was from the beginning. He has good morals and values, which gives him confidence to be the best version of himself. Meanwhile, Ken and Barbie are struggling to figure out who they are, and want to be.The dancing, choreography, and facial expressions were all done spectacularly well. The cast, including the supporting characters did a wonderful job. Gosling does an excellent job, portraying a more submissive Ken in the beginning, then more dominant, when he wants to take charge of Barbie land. Robbie's role as Barbie was much different than when she played Harley Quinn. Barbie is nice, kind, and not evil, while Harley Quinn is a criminal, who could be good from time to time. These roles show she is good at playing different parts, which will help her in the future.Not only does this movie have some funny moments, but it also has themes that are relevant to what's happening in life today. Capitalism, equality for all, female empowerment, and self-acceptance, are all things people need to know about.There is a lot of pressure on women to be perfect. Women have to go to work, which usually means getting payed less than men, taking care of the house and kids, all while looking their best, which is difficult to do all the time. Mattel hoped that Barbie would be an inspiration for women. Unfortunately, she doesn't even look like most people, Barbie is extremely skinny, which is an unrealistic standard for anyone to live up to. Along with that, the company, Mattel, and its founders aren't exactly honest people. Years after Barbie was made, Handler was found guilty of tax evasion.Barbie shows one of the reasons the WGA (Writers Guild of America) and SAG (Screen Actors Guild) are striking. They all want better pay, meanwhile the top CEO's of company's make millions a year. However, the way it should be is more equal, meet somewhere in the middle. Don't pay people so little they need multiple jobs to support their family, but also no one is asking to become a millionaire. Barbie is a good movie that happened to come out at the perfect time. I would encourage everyone to go see this movie. It was well cast and has multiple messages surrounding issues our society faces today.\",\n",
              "  'Barbie has exceeded the expectations of many viewers, what we thought was going to be a movie for \"kids\" has ended up being a movie full of social criticism, satire and a great sense of humor. The female empowerment that Greta Gerwig presents to us is relentless, showing various situations in which women find themselves involved on a daily basis, as well as various cliches that surround them.On the other hand, there is Ken who at first finds patriarchy as the best solution for society, but finally realizes that the role of women is extremely important and that without them society would collapse.The way in which Barbie has been shot is impressive, the mixture of the use of animated elements with life action makes seeing Barbie on the big screen a unique experience. I loved the duo of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, they have coexisted perfectly in Barbieland, making watching them act extremely entertaining.Without a doubt, this movie is one of a kind and I would like it to be valued for what it really is and not be forgotten like the movie about Barbie.',\n",
              "  \"This is quite possibly the most overhyped movie ever. The plot is forgettable and a-lot of the films plot points contradict the overarching themes. Barbie was horrified by the patriarchal society in the real world however when she came back she helped create a matriarchy by appointing all positions of leadership to barbies and refusing to let kens sit on the senate. The ken's were objectified throughout the movie not being given any validation but when they took over barbie threw a tantrum and refused to sympathise with them. Also the barbie's had no objection to the ken's instilling a patriarchy and rolled over immediately conforming to their rules without a second thought. They were meant to be these strong feminist characters but they did not have a mind of their own and it took the monologue of a side character's superficial problems to bring them to their senses. These issues take away from the meaning of the film and overall the idea was executed poorly. The movie has some plus points, being an partially enjoyable comedy but is not worthy of the 8* ratings. An excruciatingly mind numbing movie with some moments of laughter, wait for this one to release on DVD or streaming platforms.\",\n",

How you can never say or do things right. Its exactly how I've been feeling for years and this scene was like a burst of emotion for me to hear someone else explain exactly what I felt verbatim.I know for some critics it seemed like a confusing mess but believe me, if you are truly this films target audience, the message is portrayed perfectly. Its not meant to fix issues or show equality but it does perfectly give some light and understanding in to what women feel day to day.The marketing could be a little better but overall I am honestly really impressed with it and the nostalgia was beautiful!\",\n",

Overall I was very surprised by this film. The cinematography was very good if not artificial,the story reminded me of Elf meets The Lego Movie. Ryan Gosling was hysterical as Ken. Also stars Rhea Pherlman from Matilda,Helen Mirren as the narrator who throws fourth wall jokes,singer Dua Lipa as a mermaid and John Cena as a merman.

It's as entertaining as any random movie you'll come across on TV. It doesn't work as a musical either. There are no unique songs that will stay with you for a long time. In fact, I can't remember a movie where I found myself yawning and looking at my watch more often. I do not recommend. Perhaps the film is made for a specific audience. For me, this is one of the most boring movies I have ever watched in my life. The film and its characters make a very infantile impression. Probably only the last 10 minutes, with the old lady, caught my attention.\",\n",

The jokes land and the message sticks although feeling repetitive as the entire 3rd act was this. The soundtrack is incredible and I love how aqua was used for some songs. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. This is highly recommended to anyone who is yet to watch this. All in all this film is great, go watch if you haven't.\",\n",

Personally it got to the point where I felt as if this film should\\'ve just been a biopic about Ruth Handler, plus Rhea Perlman\\'s performance as Ruth Handler was just exciting and very heartfelt/heartwarming at the same time.Just overall, Most aspects of the film I did enjoy, it was just little things here and there, useless characters, messy writing and dialogue and the \"joke\" about Zack Snyder\\'s Justice League didn\\'t sit well with me.I will say I did like this film, I just didn\\'t LOVE it.',\n",
              "  \"Greta's satire that evidently seems like a promotion run of Mattel's creations, is beyond the pink dazzle. The sugary-adorable pastels, mostly the pink colour spreads all over the dreamy world of Barbie. Everything that makes it fancy, fizzy and fantastic are the production designs and costumes. Ebullience is lightened by the sparkling musical sequences. The Fabulous Margot Robbie as Barbie is the eminence of this Greta's clever and creative vision. The Cast is typically perfect to saturate in the fantasy. Ryan Gosling charmingly lends a kenergy in the story. The ridiculous banters strives all the way, sometimes little silly but mostly unveils the story's themes. There's a brief mention of Mattel's creation & how they flawed at a place when they aimed to represent a powerful figure. There's a slight malfunction between the fantasy and real world that alters different ideologies to flourish in the fun and laughs. The ideologies shapes into leading an unresolved fragment of humankind. The two contrasting portraits, the Patriarchy & Feminism comes in a fairy tale that once again liberalise the women and evokes them to voice up for themselves and their dilemmas & demands for a treaty for their existence and admiration which is partly void in the flawed-society. The sweet messages are beneath the glaring pink world, that adds a soul in the story. Barbie's exploration in finding the answer to the malfunction leads to many errands along the way. She realises the elegance of tears, her purpose and worth, being imperfect is normal and ultimately the self-discovery immerses in the conclusion. A pink jest is a celebration of womanhood as the flashes of memories flow. Gradually it reaches to hearts of millions with its resembling storytelling. It turns into a tender-mellow tale of Barbie, growing up to understand the sentiments of a human much more. Indeed this elegantly crafted and insightfully written tale drives to a sentimental ending. The heart would be pink, the tears would be pink, hereby you'll love pink.\",\n",

My generation was told that we are all different and special, look where that led lol. Let's be honest with each other, we live on a paradise planet, but we'd rather succumb to our worst impulses, greed, lust, etc, etc, rather than evolve and live too the standards we wish we could achieve. Rich and beautiful people rule the Earth, the rest of us work for them willingly. It is the Kens, Barbies, and the Mattel type CEOs who have the planet (for some reason we are okay with that)..Barbie isn't a billion dollar movie because of its message, thank the beautiful people who are cast and the originality/nostalgia of it!\",\n",

It's hard to be a women and Barbie really shares a perspective that I think most women feel everyday. This is an important show for both females and males to see.

My oldest daughter was so disappointed by it that she was crying after and didn't understand it to be honest - she thought it was going to be more fun because we watched the trailers over and over. I mean it was a fantastic production and a lot of creativity went into making the Barbie world but why did they have to make the Barbie characters so introspective. So much crying and melodramatic parts for a movie that should be geared towards a kids imagination. And why did the ending need to be so lame.

Barbie lives off the name and nothing more. Yes, the references to the classic toys was amusing and reminded me of me playing as a 4 year old kid with my 8 year old sisters Barbies. I laughed with my wife over those things, and there was an element of nostalgia but it was sort of trying to play the \"Toy Story\" game too seriously.Talking of which, Toy Story is probably one of the most amazing Pixar movies of all time. The story, the hidden lines, and personas; But Barbie, tried to take this and add something to it which it failed miserably at.The story is muddy at best, but the actors do their best to keep it above water to some degree, but ultimately it was a garbage storyline.Barbie essentially is a movie built on hype, it\\'s history and ultimately it\\'s name.

Anyway, what a lot of fun this film is. The concept works brilliantly and it's all carried through with self effacing charm and humour that both wins you over from the start , opening wonderfully with a parody of 2001, and then keeps you engaged throughout. Margot Robbie is perfect in the lead and Ryan Gossling couldn't be better as Ken (or one of the many Ken's), and the whole thing chugs along effortlessly and humorously. The idea of the conflict between the wonderfully created female world of Barbieland and the male dominated real world is milked for all it can give, with director Greta Gerwig hardly missing a trick.

Going in, I was expecting it to be fun and maybe a little bit meta, but I was not expecting how meta this movie was going to be. Let me explain.Before we talk about the story, I wanna talk about the soundtrack a bit. The soundtrack is pretty good not gonna lie. As of writing this, Im currently listening to \"Choose your fighter\" and that song is great. Not all the songs are amazing (i\\'m probably going to get hate for this, but \"I\\'m just Ken\" is overrated), but the ones that do are really good.Ok, now onto the story.... the story is weird. Now, going into this I was already expecting this movie to be pro-women empowerment and meta, which I was okay with, but I was not expecting how far they were going to go with it, not that that\\'s a bad thing, in fact I actually love it. I was not expecting Mattel, the company that makes Barbie, to be the bad guys, and i\\'m surprised they even signed off on that idea. The women empowerment message is also pretty good. It\\'s not your stereotypical woman empowerment message where it\\'s like \"Oh, you should be like Barbie, Barbie encourages all that\", no they actually question Barbie\\'s involvement in the women\\'s rights movement in the film and I really enjoyed that the movie is willing to look deeper into it\\'s source material and question if the thing they\\'re adapting is as good as people say it is. However, they eventually drop all that in the third act of the movie. Basically in the third act, the story switches gears and it\\'s now about the Kens trying to take over Barbie land. And I basically lost interest in the movie around then since the movie spent so long investing you in the Mattel plotline so when they switch gears to this second plot, I just wanted to go back to the other plotline.In conclusion, Barbie is a very weird movie. Not what I was expecting, but I kind of love that. I love that it questions Barbie\\'s involvement in women\\'s culture and how they\\'re willing to portray the company that makes Barbie in a negative light, but the movie falls apart during the third act because they completely change plot lines.

The daughter character doesn't contribute much to the story, she's really just that one grumpy teenage character who turns out to have a heart after all, but it just didn't make sense in the story. Next the entire corporation storyline didn't make sense at all. In the beginning it was like fine, they try to get barbie back to barbieland, but then she goes back herself, they follow her and from that point they contribute literally nothing to the story anymore. I forgot they were there until they suddenly appeared out of the bushes. It just lacked depth and logic and in my opinion it just wasn't necessary to have made the movie to what it was.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie a lot, but some plot points just weren't what I expected them to be.

I think the director of the movie didn't fully understand what she wanted to show in the movie and for whom it was created. It has things that are usually typical for younger audiences, but at the same time it touches on adult themes that will not be understood by younger audiences. Let me be clear.The movie as a whole is well-made. The music is cool, they put a lot of effort into it. Costumes, scenery and many other things are very good. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are excellent. The idea of what's going on is generally interesting. The manner of the movie and the plot are not complicated, which is good for the younger audience. The comedy makes you chuckle at times. The adult themes touched on in the movie are interesting to me in this way, but it didn't come out quite fully realized.With this, not complicated plot tries to reveal adult themes. If one part can be called a family comedy, the other part is a drama, raising existential questions and other issues of society (the latest is quite generalized and can be suitable for all audiences). Thus, it is something of a sort of trying to sit on two chairs audiences. I personally, was interested in watching the adult part, when on the more comedic part, after about half of the movie, I was already bored and dragged out. And considering myself an adult audience, watching this kind of family comedy was just okay, but connecting it to adult themes is not really the right thing to do.To summarize, I would say that this is a movie for a more adult audience. I can't say it's for an adult audience that would like to be younger, as this format of movie plots are not appealing to them.\",\n",

The idea being \"we have been fooled. We were told feminism had succeeded and now we find out they had been playing with us\". To me, the use of the Barbie world and the Barbie concept is fantastic, as she\\'s supposedly been for generations of girls, the icon, the perfect woman with the perfect life achieving all she wanted. But at the same time she has been accused of embodying all that is wrong: unrealistic expectations regarding body image etc etc. Steteotypical Barbie realizing that she\\'s been living in a bubble and the real world is not what she has been told is simply a flawless way of transmitting the message. We are all Barbie at some point.The actors performances are simply perfect. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling could not have done a better job. The stenography, the colors, the clothes, everything is just a delight.This is by far the best movie I\\'ve seen this year. I know some people find it shallow, not for children, unfunny.

It felt like the writers thought, \"We can\\'t just continue to make jokes, we need a story.\" And then it fell down.This is about Barbie having some kind of existential crisis; rallying against the past and previous beliefs about women\\'s role in society. And it got kind of boring to be honest; and its light-hearted, satirical edge is lost. It became a little preachy about gender based roles in society.The main message as far as I could tell is that it is ok to be normal, to be average, and ignore the pressure of striving towards excellence and achievement. This is ok, but it just feels flat; and it got lost and because of the entertaining first hour.

              "  '\"Barbie\" has always been a beacon of aspiration and fantasy for millions across the globe, and the 2023 movie continues to build upon that legacy. However, what sets this film apart from its predecessors is its surprising infusion of humor which elevates the story from the traditional, sparkling veneer of Barbie\\'s world.The movie makes a daring pivot from the doll\\'s typically flawless persona, highlighting her humorous and human-like qualities. The result is a delightful concoction of wit, charm, and engaging storytelling. For those expecting a mere reiteration of the standard Barbie tropes, this film will be a pleasant surprise, as it dares to shake up the status quo with its fresh take.The screenplay is an unexpected delight, with laugh-out-loud moments woven seamlessly into the narrative. The humor doesn\\'t feel forced or out of place, rather it helps to break down the often-perfect facade of Barbie\\'s world, making it more relatable to the audience. It\\'s refreshing to see Barbie and her friends involved in hilarious situations, making the narrative enjoyable for both children and adults alike.Moreover, the animation is top-notch, a delightful feast for the eyes. The detailing in each frame, the vibrant color palette, and the lifelike character animations truly capture the spirit of the Barbie world. The voice acting is commendable, breathing life into the beloved characters, and the comedic timing only adds to the film\\'s charm.The movie is not without its flaws. Some may argue that the plot is predictable and lacks depth, a criticism often faced by films in the Barbie franchise. Despite this, the film makes up for it with its humorous approach, which keeps the audience engaged throughout.Overall, \"Barbie\" (2023) is a delightful, light-hearted film that offers a fresh and funny perspective on a beloved franchise. It retains its core appeal for younger audiences while adding elements of humor that can be appreciated by a broader demographic.

He really does fit into Ken\\'s clothes.Plus the Pink Barbie Corvette and Caravan are stuff you\\'ll want to take home with you.What I loved: The plethora of Barbies (including the deleted ones) and all the various Kens (don\\'t forget John Cena as Merman Ken)\\nListen for: Dame Helen Mirren\\'s hilarious narration that breaks the fourth wall.The Production Design is so elaborate that you\\'ll want to explore \"Barbie Land\" in more detail using the pause button when this Big Screen flick moves to BluRay and Streaming.The movie features a contemporary soundtrack that includes a nod to Aqua\\'s \"Barbie Girl\".Unfortunately the Third Act lets down the movie.On the way to its denouement \"Barbie\" turns into \"Barbie the Musical\"with more singing and dancing than \"La La Land\" in the \"Beach Off\".\"Barbie\" she\\'s everything.

And as far as the depth of the 'message' is concerned, all I can say to the writers and director is: do not give up your day job.There is nothing wrong with delivering an important message, however, to be effective it must be done with persuasion and not a sledgehammer.

Mattel is very supportive of what it says, it\\'s actually really forward of them that they enabled this to happen. Greta took a chance and rather than making just another studio movie, she crafted a masterpiece. \"Barbie\" is all about self-identity and discovery and it\\'s a journey to accepting once self and loving it. \"Barbie\" is the Barbie doll we know and still this movie showcases the effect of her on our lives now. It examines all the good and the bad \"Barbie\" has given to the world. It\\'s a movie by a female director with a clear vision and a clear goal, it\\'s made with absolute love and respect for the source material and with an eye for every minor detail. \"Barbie\" is a movie made by someone who knows the Barbie doll. \"Barbie\" is a funny movie, it really is very funny and so much fun. Margot Robbie is \"Barbie\", you simply believe it. She\\'s given us her absolute best and it shows in every frame. Ryan Gosling must have had an absolute blast with Ken.

I didn't grow up with Barbies so I'm sure a lot of the jokes went over my head. But it didn't hurt the enjoyment. It even manages to land a sentimental note at the end.

              "  'Barbie is a film that revolves around fun and enjoyment. The story centers on our titular character, Barbie, in her world full of pink, numerous other Barbies and Kens, unique rules, and a repetitive daily routine. The movie overflows with laughter, clever remarks, musical numbers, dazzling sets, existential crises, and much more.Margot Robbie, portraying Barbie, and Ryan Gosling, playing Ken, thoroughly embodied their roles to the fullest. As the main character in her world, Barbie is admired by everyone and sought after for attention. She must adhere to the \"Stereotypical Barbie\" image with flawless perfection, which can become exhausting over time. On the other hand, Ken serves as the placeholder character for the public, and with his dry humor, he delivers the majority of laughs throughout the film, showcasing his unwavering adoration for Barbie.Director Greta Gerwig, known for her unique storytelling, showcases her creativity once again in Barbie. The dialogue is woven in a way that allows for multiple interpretations, enabling Barbie to discuss her own world and even extend beyond it. The movie transcends the boundaries of a typical comedy at times and addresses issues that resonate in our own world.The bold choice of including a reference to \\'2001: A Space Odyssey\\' before the actual start sets an enthralling mood. The film initially feels like an episode from the Twilight Zone, with the repeating day trope, but gradually reveals something amiss. These daring choices elevate Barbie from being just another comedy movie to a film with a deliberate vision.Barbie slightly teeters on the edge of delivering patriarchal messages, especially towards the end, but it manages to steer clear of crossing the line. As one of the original feminist icons since her creation in 1959, certain types of comments were inevitable. The movie addresses these issues with eloquence, all while remembering its primary purpose is to entertain and offer an escape to a fictional world.The marketing strategy for Barbie is nothing short of brilliant. Pairing it with Oppenheimer, a drastically different film, for a double feature is a stroke of genius. Viewers have the choice to immerse themselves first in the bubbly and joyful world of Barbie, followed by the thought-provoking story of Oppenheimer. The success of this marketing approach is evident in the box office results, as many attendees opted for both screenings, turning it into a global film festival with two back-to-back films.The production design, as showcased in the dazzling trailers, is impeccable, packed with intricate details, easter eggs, various era Barbies and Kens, and more. The commitment put into curating these elements from different years and presenting them in an engaging manner is commendable.Barbie arrives at an interesting time, with both writers and actors on strike, and Hollywood on the verge of temporary closure. However, the combination of Barbie and Oppenheimer offers audiences a choice and a break from the usual superhero or unnecessary sequel movies. Barbie delivers abundant laughter, lively music, outstanding performances, and takes viewers on an immensely enjoyable journey.',\n",
              "  'BARBIEHEIMER is among us! Between BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER releasing on the same week, the wife really wanted to see this first and I obliged.BARBIE is definitely bound to have some divisiveness due to its \"feminism\" - and yes a lot of feminism (honestly what did you expect). Not addressing this is like not addressing the nuclear bomb in OPPENHEIMER. For a movie about a children\\'s toy, I got to give it some kudos for its subversion and tying to put out a message this big. I\\'m not shocked that the film focused a bit more on the reality elements of the real world as opposed to the fantasy side. A lot of that is because this is a Greta Gerwig film (co-written with her partner Noah Baumbach) and she is one of the best working director/writer today.The unconventional approach is something to admire. The film swings with these metaphysical ideas and existential crisis. The performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling carry the film. Robbie tackles the role very well. The story asks her to do a lot, and Robbie showcases Barbie\\'s awakening with sincerity, terror, confusion, naivety, humor and bittersweet acceptance. Gosling gets to cut loose and be funny. He goes on his own journey to discovering who he is so there\\'s layers to his Ken as well. He also has a funny rivalry/banter with Simu Liu\\'s Ken.Rest of the supporting cast are a bit underdeveloped, but they get moments to shine here and there and serve the plot in motion. Some highlights are Kingsley Ben-Adir, Issa Rae, Michael Cera and Kate McKinnon.America Ferrara and Ariana Greenblatt are the human mother/daughter duo in the film. Ferrara\\'s character delivers a monolog that is very on the nose and at that point you\\'re with it or meh about it. For me personally, I honestly don\\'t mind it as long as its entertaining, and to the film\\'s credit it was, for at least the first act of the film. It\\'s at its best with the self aware meta humor, but eventually the film gets too carried away and takes itself too seriously, loosing its humor and leaving us experiencing moments that are a bit of a chore to sit through.One could say it was refreshing to watch an incredibly self aware film that isn\\'t afraid to be bold in its message, but for me, while I agree with the underlying message it\\'s very heavy handed and preachy. I connected more when the film explored the nature of Barbie\\'s character. There\\'s one scene that tackles Barbie\\'s legacy directly that raised the existential crisis for her, but it isn\\'t revisited in favor of telling a bigger societal story.Production design, the sets and visuals are very well done. Shoutout to production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorators Katie Spencer. I feel like Barbie could take home the Oscar for production design. When you\\'re in Barbie Land, the overall usage of pink and the plastic feel makes the whole experience feel immersive. Cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto makes the film feel like you\\'re there. It has a vibrant and inviting energy that you can\\'t help but gaze at.I am curious how some families who saw the film feel about it as some might have expected a more straight forward approach, as opposed to this more nuanced subversive take, but I think overall the film is destined to be enjoyed overall and successful. It just might get a sequel if it can rake in the money, which it looks like it will.As a male, this film isn\\'t made for me. I\\'m obviously not the target audience for it. However, the film did enough to make me feel engaged where I laughed at some jokes, but the second half is where I felt the film was talking at me instead of engaging me as a viewer. It flirts with being a unique fantasy/real world introspective story, but then seems to be more interested in making a point by the end of it.6/10.',\n",

I went to the cinema with an open mind and in the back of my head with the idea that I knew this might not be it for me.Overall the movie is packed with some great humor and a beautiful underlying story about who Barbie really is. If you look at the cast you'll see that all the women that portray Barbie are also called Barbie, but this movie, as well as the dolls in real life show that a Barbie can be anything. Even though our main Barbie played by the magnificent Margot Robbie was the ''stereotypical Barbie'' and I did like some of the more versatile characters, I still think they could have done better than having one bigger Barbie and one in a wheelchair.I admit that 9 is a high rating but after leaving the movie theatre 24 hours later and stil stuck with the lyrics of Ryan Gosling singing ''I'm just Ken'', I can't help but to give a solid 9.Although this movie in any other context might be ''forgettable'', it is still a Barbie movie and it was just good fun. The humor was good, the cast was great and the soundtrack might be one of the strongest things about the movie. The outfits, especially worn by Margot Robbie were stunning.This movie is not going to be for everyone. It was very fake, theatrical and very ''Barbie (of course).

The writing, the characters, the set, and the outfits were so brilliantly curated. I do not even hesitate to say it is now one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies I have EVER seen. Greta Gerwig is nothing less than a genius and deserves ALL of the recognition. The casting was perfection. The meaning behind the movie holds a special place in my heart and EVERY SINGLE PERSON NEEDS to see this movie.

Then stereotypical Barbie starts getting dark thoughts, which can only be due to the human who is playing with her in the Real World. So, accompanied by Ken, Barbie sets off through the rip in reality to find the relevant human, only to find that the Real World is not at all like Barbieland. And Ken discovers patriarchy. And horses.As a film, this is an enjoyable mess. It aims to be toy nostalgia for little girls of all ages, escapist silliness, wild fantasy, social satire with well-staged musical production numbers, in fact a bizarre mix of elements which shoukdn't work together, but somehow do. It's bright, colourful, tuneful, quite funny, well played, sometimes thoughtful and thought-provoking, mikdly feminist (though not without taking pokes at feminism and vacuous femininity as well as toxic masculinity) and, broadly, good-hearted. Helen Mirren's narration is dry and funny, and the last line is a killer.Looking at the film as a social phenomenon, I have two observations. One, a lot of people have got their knickers in a twist, and they are mostly males who feel very threatened by the mildly feminist message in this movie ABOUT DOLLS. This film is not is big a deal as it thinks it is, and it's certainly not as big a deal as wounded males seem to think it is. Two the cinema was packed (two-thirds female) and the audience seemed to enjoy it. The only films I have seen filling cinemas in recent years have been aimed at female audiences. No comment!\",\n",

Makes sense in order to explain the historical connotations about the franchise's history,but on rewatch I'll fast forward to the cheesy funny parts. Would I watch it again? Probably!!!!!!!!

While it had its strengths, like Ryan Gosling\\'s exceptional performance and emotionally impactful scenes, I found the film to be a bit overloaded with messages. Some parts were polarizing, and the humor occasionally missed the mark.Spoiler alert: The film\\'s message about embracing uncertainty and self-discovery was commendable, but the execution sometimes seemed confusing. The protagonist\\'s journey towards self-acceptance could have led her to a simple job, symbolizing personal growth. Instead, the choice to visit a gynecologist seemed a little too on the nose.One standout aspect was the beautiful message conveyed through Billie\\'s song, which added an exquisite touch to the film. Overall, I\\'d rate \"Barbie\" 7/10 stars for its strong performances and emotional moments, but it could have benefited from a more focused approach to its messages.',\n",
              "  'In one sense, this film was more inevitable than Thanos. What do you get when you\\'re part of a society that fuels existential crises, by constantly eroding definitions and structures? Barbie and Ken aren\\'t exactly human (they don\\'t even have genitals); they\\'re embodied ideas, and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presuppositional views of a happy society against that of the \"real world.\" But their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking it\\'s a dragon. So how much can an audience glean from the pontifications of characters who are essentially children? I would have greatly preferred scriptwriters more well-versed in sociology as well as comedy, writers who understand not only American ideals, and how those ideals have shifted, but the role that Barbie has played along the way. I get the sense that the writers here just KNOW Barbie had some impact, without really understanding much beyond that. There was so much to explore, and it could have been shown situationally, rather than through heavy-handed exposition.Off-screen, apparently Ken had some interesting realizations about his misunderstandings of patriarchy, and Barbie had some realizations about how she treated Ken, but we don\\'t get to see any of this nuance actually played out. Hugely missed opportunities there.Bottom line: As fantastic as Robbie and Gosling were, I wish this movie just didn\\'t exist. Keep the cast, but try again with a much better script and director.',\n",

Not only did this movie have incredible humor, but a deep insight to what it means to be a woman. The light it brought to the deep connection to mother\\'s and daughters...especially the moment shared between Margot Robbie and Ruth Handler, was nothing short of a tear-jerker. Not only that, but the wide spectrum of representation of connection between women was remarkable; from the shared struggle of patriarchal restraints we experience to the common childhood memories of playing with dolls. I have seen some critics who hate magic, fun, and women, be quick to hate on the heavy speech America Ferrera gives in the third act about standards women must meet. Sure, it didn\\'t fit the theme of Barbieland\\'s perfect, pink atmosphere, but it was a powerful message needed to strengthen the impact of the movie. Her message was followed by an applause by the audience of the theater I was in.I left the theater in awe of how incredible this movie was and how incredible this movie made me feel. It spoke to me in ways that cheesy, \"relatable\", lazily anti-capitalist and cheap feminist media could never do. This movie is brilliant and inspiring for young girls such as myself. I felt loved and seen throughout this whole movie and felt so strongly about it I went through the hassle of making a damn IMDB account and writing an essay that wasn\\'t required by a teacher or school project. I actually felt the need to share how this movie impacted me instead of letting the horse loving Ken\\'s of the world speak over the women who felt a real connection to this movie. It is beautiful and a must watch.',\n",
              "  \"Barbie is enjoyable, thats for sure, but it brings some problems such as the films plot, which is all over the place, and goes in a lot of unlikable directions at times. However, this doesn't bring the film down, as there are enjoyable and smart aspects of the film that climb the hurdles to make Barbie an enjoyable summer watch that caters for all ages!The film kicks things off in Barbie land, and its here where audiences will start to fall in love with the aesthetics of the film. Astonishing set designs,usage of visual fx and cinematography really help us step into the shoes of a Barbie doll. The first act of the film really focus on this idea, and almost shows off the impressive work that has been put into the creation of this sublime world.It is when we delve further into this plot though that we start to see issues. The whole vibe the film gives off and its tone surprisingly shifts into something much darker and political when the real world gets involved. It is definitely far from unwatchable though, and the charm of the characters and the humor actually make this specific part of the storyline enjoyable. Despite being fun, the story goes off track a lot, completely ignoring any form of logic to take risks by giving off a little too many messages that only makes the plot more predictable and clich√©.The individual, interior journeys these characters go on though is the clear standout of the film for me. The arcs of almost all characters are played out really cleverly, and whilst the story as a whole is a mess, the developing dynamics between the Barbie's and the Ken's make this film worth watching alone. What is done with these characters is really fitting to some of the messages the film tries to give off, even though it may seem there are too many to process.Acting is phenomenal. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are CLEAR standouts, yet all cast members have their moments.Ultimately, Barbie does get messy, especially when the real-world comes to play. Yet its the exploration of Barbie Land and what it means to be a barbie that make this a fun, yet somewhat perceptive, summer watch!\",\n",
              "  \"When I sat down to watch this film I assumed it would be some fun pink silly movie but it was not in the best possible way. It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom. Robbie was an amazing Barbie and all the women shined in this movie...and Alan was pretty good too. It was everything you can want from a movie, sharp, whitty, moving, honest and progressive. The perfect Barbie.\",\n",

Ryan Gosling didn't meet up to that standard however that is more due to the script he was given rather than himself. Nice to see cameos from Rob Brydon and Asim Chaudhry.Cinematography: Set in both 'Barbie Land' and the 'Real World', the lighting remained saturated and vivid throughout the film, embodying the standard lightheartedness of a fantasy comedy film. The scenes in the 'Real World' were less vibrant than 'Barbie Land', creating a strong wall that separates the troubles of the 'Real World' and 'Barbie Land'.Writing: With the aim to spread awareness about gender quality, Barbie did not meet this objective. Unison wasn't able to be built between men and women as the film took the approach to put the genders against eachother, making it a competitive fight to overthrow one another.Pacing: Despite being 2 hours long, the film felt fairly quick but had some sequences which loses the audiences attention.Audience: Although the traditional barbie dolls are targeted towards young children, this film is applicable to persons aged 12 and over due to the political and social subjects of the plotline.\",\n",
              "  \"Didn't watch the trailer and went to see the Barbie movie, thinking it would be a regular comedy about a doll. I liked the idea of dressing up in pink with my daughter and going to a girly movie. But I was very surprised when I found out that there was a deep meaning hidden in the pink world of Barbie Land! The movie touches on women's issues: being always perfect, managing everything, being beautiful, perfect mothers, cooks, careerists and wives. The movie also shows men who don't know who they are without their women, cars, jobs. I cried, I was moved by the dialogues. I loved the movie! I was especially impressed by the moment at the bus stop, when Barbie sat next to an old lady and praised her for her beauty. The old lady smiled and said: I know :) It was so cute and wise! It made me realize that growing old is not scary if you love yourself as you are. You don't need to chase youth, there is beauty and dignity in every age. I am grateful to the directors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach for making the Barbie movie not only a fun comedy, but also a deep drama about finding yourself and your place in the world. They showed that Barbie is not just a doll, but a heroine who can be anyone and do anything. They also honored the memory of Ruth Handler, who gave millions of girls the opportunity to dream and strive for the best. I think that the Barbie movie is not only a movie for children, but also for adults who want to go back to their roots and find their inner beauty. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves Barbie or just wants to watch a good movie with an important message.\",\n",

I wound up texting some of my girlfriends that thought it was just for kids & told them to give it a try. I got back some \"are you serious?\" texts but I said yes, give it a try.

Not to mention if you want popcorn and snacks. I recommend Wait until it's on a streaming service you already have or at your local library where you can get it for free.

This was like a fever dream and I can't wait to take all my friends to the cinema to watch this movie again and again. I did not expect to be so entertained but also shedding tears. A movie everyone should go and watch. And how beautiful that Billie Eilish song was! We will definitely hear it live next year at the Academy Awards, where I hope Greta and the whole team will get recognition for creating this (already) iconic film. Production design, script, directing, acting (especially Ryan bodied that role) and Best original song I would want to see awarded.\",\n",
              "  \"Consistently entertaining, imaginative, and occasionally wickedly funny, Greta Gerwig helms an audaciously original take on the iconic doll, fashioning a pastel wonderland with deeper, albeit crudely pushed, morals and ideas. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, the stereotypical perfect doll whose carefree existence in the utopian Barbieland is one day disrupted, leading her eventually into the real world, accompanied by the hapless Ken, played by Ryan Gosling in a valiant attempt to drag character from caricature.Baumbach and Gerwig's script is loaded with references and nods to many aspects of pop culture, pulling them off pretty successfully with the aid of Gerwig's direction, which matches the tone of the script perfectly, at turns breathlessly light and then scathingly precise.The production design team in particular clearly got much of the funding, with lush and detailed sets, picture-perfect outfits, and enough pink to cause a temporary world shortage of the colour. Robbie in particular does a fabulous job of capturing the subtleties of inner struggles behind a perfect facade, and it is on her character that the movie finds its feet and produces sparks of deeper emotion. Gosling, meanwhile, delivers some of the best comedic timing and lines of the movie, and does his best to convince us that the script did not severely underwrite his role, or in fact the roles of everyone save the idea of womanhood.For a movie which purports to deliver a nuanced take on the influence of Barbie and the implications of its commercial success in a world admittedly mostly governed by men, parts of the script come off as overly preachy and about as subtle as the amount of pink in this movie. This does detract from the entertainment factor, especially with the mild stakes and average pacing, meaning that when you're looking at it, it's nice to look at, but you could easily not be looking at it either.Many of the ideas introduced are thought-provoking and interesting in the context of the meaning of humanity, especially in the first two acts. In the third, much of those ideas get resolved far too easily, and on a couple occasions, in a manner which undercuts the message of equality it purports to show.There are some standout moments, especially a ridiculously funny and entertaining sequence featuring Gosling's Ken towards the end, and one or two impactful, quiet moments where Robbie and Gerwig gel together perfectly, but in between them is a vacuous fantasy that rests somewhere comfortably between bubblegum fluff and feminist hit piece.Another thing to note is the music, which is superb throughout, and matched mostly by Gerwig's direction and her staging of some great sequences.Never a struggle to watch, shot through with occasionally successfully executed ideas, it leaves one with a good feeling, but nothing as lasting as it wishes it could be.\",\n",

Obviously the movies couldn\\'t be more different. I saw \"Oppenheimer\" last weekend, as arms control experts had recommended seeing it before \"Barbie\" after all, she lives in the world that he helped bring about.Anyway, this movie addresses the issue of how we define gender roles, and of course looks at matriarchy versus patriarchy. The plot actually reminded me of the 2007 Disney flick \"Enchanted\", with the idea of an ultra-feminine character from an apparently perfect world suddenly coming to the real world.All in all, it\\'s an over-the-top but enjoyable flick. You\\'ll probably leave the theater asking yourself what it means to be a man or a woman. Along with Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, the cast includes America Ferrera, Simu Liu, Emma Mackey, Ncuti Gatwa, Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell, Helen Mirren and Michael Cera.

The sets were gorgeous, according to behind the scenes, everything was practical when it could be, and that made such an obvious difference in bringing the Barbie world to life. The costumes!!! So much fun, so much pink, and Robbie's long-standing relation with chanel wormed it's way into costuming as well, truly there are a bunch of unique and extremely well done pieces!However, this is still a movie made to appeal to the widest audience to make the most money possible. There's some popular feminism, but nothing that challenges status quo, and nothing too disagreeable for the average audience. It's pretty to look at, but lacks adequate substance in favor of just bringing up the talking point to say they acknowledged it. Furthermore the movie is extremely uninterested in exploring anything about Mattel's business practices or perpetual consumerism. Not that I was expecting it to, but both those potential issues are very blatantly sidelined and made for humor which sometimes feels like a bit much for me.Anyways, if you want a pretty looking and pretty funny movie that'll definitely continue to make a stupid amount of money, it is well worth it!\",\n",

The way Stereotypical Barbie changes is a pleasant surprise. And the way this movie deals with problems in modern society upfront and, while admittedly toned down a bit, they're all still there. The plot of this movie makes it a fantastic watch, and I was delighted by not only how the jokes were seamlessly thrown in, but the jokes themselves. This movie wasn't only just Kenough. This was so much more than being just Kenough for the children and adults in the audience. The movie's so self-aware, but it isn't the usual type, this is a type of self-awareness that can lead you to view the world differently.

Margot Robbie as Barbie was perfect casting and the theatre was filled , everybody had a good time . I should give this score maybe a bit higher but I just felt it was just a bunch of things mashed together I was watching a parody episode of South Park which is not a bad thing , I though it was the right direction for a movie called Barbie .

Montage is glued together from parts what was filmed in different places and times into a single scenes and it HURTS MY EYES. This movie has too much easter eggs for a young audience, it's too dumb and caricature for an adult movie.What really makes it bad is director work. So much things would be stunning if, for example Wes Anderson worked with the scene and cameras, whilst the movie is somewhere on the level of She-Hulk by the quality of montage.It was a waste of time and I do not blame the actors for that: it was failed by plots, dialogues and writing.\",\n",

I will continue to watch an average movie when the analogies made on the internet seem to confirm my suspicions. But Barbie is hiding with a pretty well-written script. He uses drama in the parts that should be serious, and humor in the parts. From that moment on, the script can be both preserved and conveyed to the audience much better. Moreover, when the editing is at a fluent pace, you watch the movie breathlessly. The fact that its duration is under two hours is also nice considering the length of mainstream movies in recent years.',\n",

The storyline and characters are serviceable, yet they don't offer the level of intricacy that one might find in films aimed at a broader age range.

The script, however, was not that solid.They were going for a direct, transparent, explain the deep themes of the story type of dialogue, but it often had a hard time landing. Particularly at the beginning. Some things felt spoon-fed to the audience, as if they weren't going to understand the givens of Ken realizing he loved the patriarchy because he felt he had never had any voice in Barbie Land. We visually understand it, but then it is explained a fee times through on the nose dialogue which felt unnecessary.The pacing of the film feels a bit awkward at times. You also never fuuully connect with the characters and their struggles, even though Margot Roby and Ryan Gosling are amazing actors and enjoyable to watch. You're following a line of events and laid out comments about the patriarchy and the place of women in todays world. But it was exactly the most profound (which is fiiiine, it's a movie about a doll after-all, but if they were going for this pov they should've dug deeper, in my opinion).I love all the actors involved, and the work of Greta Gerwig and the work of Noah Baumbach. But this wasn't their best work.I would still recommend seeing it to form your own opinion. You can still enjoy the world, the acting, and have a laugh here and there. Also, for people who have never taken a look at our binary, sexist, and patriarchal society, it could be eye opening. For my part, I often think about how exhausting it is to live in a world where men are in most positions of power and impose their ways on others, particularly women, so I wanted more out of the argument of the movie.

              "  \"I finally plucked up the courage and wore my usual all black clothes as I braved the hordes of pink wearing women to watch Barbie the latest release from director Great Gerwig. The film opens with a voice over from Helen Mirren telling us how Barbie changed the doll business, no longer did young girls just have dolls that were encouraging them to stay in the kitchen now they had barbie who could have any career with the change of an outfit. Straight away this should tell you about the gender politics of this film but more on that later. We then cut to Barbieland where everything is plastic and fantastic that is until one day Barbie out loud says do you ever think about death? (Is there not a therapist barbie?). From there starts an adventure where Barbie and Ken travel to the real world, barbie in search of her owner to find the source of her new found depressive thoughts and Ken well in search of Barbies heart.This film is a hard one to unpick as it's just chaos, there's so much going on all the time, so much so that the slower moments act as nice breathers for the audience. There's dance sequences, action sequences, jokes, gender politics and somewhere in here there's the typical Barbie plot that you might presume this film would have but it's covered with loads of other stuff. The thing I'm most torn on with this film is that I want to praise Gerwig for creating a Barbie film that no one would have predicted while at the same time I can't help wondering if I personally would have enjoyed it more had it been more generic. I'm always talking about how films should be more creative and yet this is the question this film has me asking myself. It's just different and it definitely isn't a kids film, a young girl sat a couple of rows behind me had to keep asking her mum what was going on and I don't blame her as if I was 6,7,8 years old I wouldn't have had a clue. This film seems to be aimed at women Greta's age which is a surprise to me as I thought she was in her late twenties for some reason but you can Google her actual age if you wish to know. Now I know her actual age some of the more older niche references to bands and films etc make more sense and I think it's women that are a similar age to her that she's trying to appeal to here.That brings me onto the films central theming which is its gender politics. It's a film that's about women and for women and in that it does a great job, I think for its target audience it could be an impactful and empowering piece of art. That being said however if you're a pre teen girl or a man you might not get the full emotional impact of this film and I feel that's a bit of a missed opportunity. If this film had eased up on the gender politics at times I think it could have appealed to a wider audience and in doing so may have been able to spread the films message further but I think it's largely ended up falling on death ears to those who aren't in its target audience. It's a shame because the film has an important message to share about equality but it's one that men need to get onboard with as much as women to bring about any real change.By the way, for a film that's supposed to be telling women to be who they are and challenge the patriarchy why has a trend been created for women to wear pink to this film considering it's one of the most commonly associated colours with women?Overall I'm not the target audience for this film but I had a good time nonetheless, it's not one I'll be hurrying back too with haste though.\",\n",

I always love seeing Issa Rae anywhere and I think she should be everywhere because she's so talented. I can't say enough about America Ferrera's monologue rant - the writing of that monologue was spectacular but Ferrera's delivery of it was one of my favourite scenes in this movie.I think Greta Gerwig's work here is incredible and I think this movie will be remembered for many years to come.\",\n",

Even though I tried to ignore the very delusional message throughout, the ending makes no sense. Barbie herself ends up not solving her problem, still being confused, and staying in the real world when she wanted everything back to normal during the whole movie. That makes no sense whatsoever. The very last line of dialogue is a fail of a joke too. The director obviously did not know how to end the movie.',\n",

Ryan Gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, but don\\'t sleep on Michael Cera as Allan. I know a lot of people say that Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer, but personally I thought Michael was.The soundtrack also works really within the film. I don\\'t know how many of them I would listen to separately. I also wouldnt be suprised if either \"Im just Ken\" or \"What was I made for?\" or both was nominated for an oscar. Speaking of oscars, I think this is also has a good chance of being nominated for production design, costumes, hair and makeup - because visually this movie is such a treat.Now I dont think all aspects worked for me. I don\\'t think the Mattel/CEO subplot was needed. There could have been another way for her to go back to Barbieland organically. I felt like the film was already tackling a lot with themes of patriarchy and feminism and having this \"chase scene\" didnt add much. Also, Gloria\\'s (America Ferrera) monologue. Now, dont get me wrong I think there is a lot truth to it. But I just found it somewhat one-note. It didn\\'t exactly blow me away as it has for others. And lastly, I undertstand the importance of having Ruth Handler featured in the movie....just a little weird that it was represented as her being a ghost that lives in Mattel headquarters.Overall, I would definitely recommend the film.

Will Ferrell showing up was kinda weird not gonna lie, but he did fit into his \"bumbling idiot in charge of everything\" role perfectly. I would also love to see other men step up and say they enjoyed this movie. It was like sitting through a good roast. We should also listen to the true message, and make way for a more equal world.

I don't really enjoy it when a highly extravaganted issues is being shoved into my face. I honestly cannot understand how the producers thought that's the way to do it.

              "  \"Barbie offers a delightful and fun-filled experience, encompassing chuckles, joy, and, surprisingly, some deeper discussions surrounding its creation's intended impact on feminism versus the portrayal of opposing views on women in real life. It even delves into the influence of patriarchy, hyper-masculinity, and its effects on the mental and emotional struggles women face daily. Initially, I found myself a bit confused since it wasn't quite what I expected. The movie touched on dark themes like death, which left me wanting more answers, especially since it was mentioned often, but it didn't tie up that loose end.Despite that, the film doesn't target kids but rather adults who once played with Barbies. For the moms out there, it's definitely a movie worth watching.However, I'm conflicted because it felt like the movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to accomplish. With so many themes and stories to tell, it somewhat detracts from the overall impact. Nevertheless, it remains an enjoyable experience that nostalgically brings back memories. I'd give Barbie The Movie a rating of 7.5/10. The hype, dressing up, and reliving childhood memories add to its appeal.\",\n",

The acting isn't great from anyone, and the script just seems strange and doesn't make much sense. It's like a cross between several different films and it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.

The exploration of the patriarchy in the \\'real\\' world is eerily accurate. The raw, unadulterated expression of the dilemmas of womanhood is one which speaks for women and girls all around the world.I appreciate how the movie concluded with not the return of the matriarchal Barbieland, but an effort to strive for equilibrium, which acknowledges the sentiments of both men and women, which is a progressive message to carry out.Handler\\'s dissertation on the immortality of ideas, and essence of humanity was quite profound.The acting, everyone\\'s, was entertaining and impeccable, without it , the movie could never be just as good.The soundtrack, while song-oriented, was still effective at projecting the vibe and aesthetic of the movie into one\\'s ears.Overall, this movie is more than just \"glitter and sparkles\", it symbolically confronts the facets of our society.

The humor is excellent and made me genuinely laugh out loud. Not to mention the brilliance of Allan.On the other side, the film has an agenda and they push it hard.

Unfortunately, Greta Gerwig\\'s movie is just a little too cute: the central character is \"stereotypical Barbie\", another character is \"Mr. Mattel\", when Margot Robbie\\'s character loses confidence in her own attractiveness, a voiceover tells us that Margot Robbie was the wrong person to cast if you wanted this scene to be convincing.

The film quickly and suddenly goes into mature themes, where the narrative shifts to gender roles in society, mostly on women.But as soon as the line \"Do you ever think about dying?\" drops, you are in for something different. Weirdly enough, this reminded me of The Lego Movie, and what is even stranger is that it stars Will Ferrell.One of the most amusing parts I got from the movie is that the film feels \"insidery\" and what I mean by that is that it speaks to women and is made for them, which only they will truly understand. So, any comedic or emotional scenes regarding female experiences will have a bigger laugh and impact for them, while the guys are not picking it up. On the other hand, it manages not to alienate, and that\\'s very tricky to pull off. Anyone can still enjoy it, but it\\'s just something I notice with the audience.

She portrayed her character\\'s feelings, thoughts, and inner turmoil beautifully. It\\'s another ensemble film where everyone does solid work.But man, Ryan Gosling as Ken is fantastic. Gosling is one of the best comedic talents of today. I would say this - Gosling\\'s casting as Ken is up there with Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean. I hope he gets an Oscar nomination for this. Yep, I am dead serious. Whenever Gosling was on screen, I was smiling from ear to ear. His passion for the character is both amusing and hilarious. His musical number I\\'m Just Ken was the highlight.Director Greta Gerwig is one of the most unique voices in cinema right now. Her influences with classic cinema, mostly in music, dance, and rich visuals are on display here. Her directing for the musical segments, especially with \\'I\\'m Just Ken\\', is fantastic.The movie has flaws. It can get overstuffed with so much going on, and the preachy message can be too much at points. It needed more nuance. But that is it for problems.If you are a guy, check this one out. Go out of your comfort zone.With the internet phenomenon known as Barbenheimer, who would have thought that a movie based on a doll and another film about the creation of the nuclear bomb would save cinema?

She always knows how to pull off that intense third act monologue about being a woman that hits you right in your soul and causes you to rethink everything.I have never seen a movie that explains how exhausting it is to be a woman not only around men, but around other women. America Ferrera, who plays Gloria, has a insanely heartfelt beautiful monologue where she says \"i\\'m just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us\" and i have never felt something deeper in my heart.Never thought i\\'d say this but this movie absolutely changed my life and i will love it for life.',\n",

While the central idea is commendable, the execution fell somewhat short for me. The plot became predictable once the main theme was revealed, and I could foresee the unfolding events and the movie\\'s conclusion.Undoubtedly, the movie\\'s core message is strong, but I couldn\\'t fully embrace its realization. I agree with the critics\\' observations regarding the one-dimensional portrayal of male characters and the lack of true equality in the ending, despite the intentions.Still, \"Barbie\" has several strengths. The visual style is captivating, and the beauty of Barbieland is truly enchanting. In addition, the actors deliver commendable performances that add depth to their characters.On the downside, some of the characters who are not dolls themselves seem a bit too childish in their behavior, which detracts from the overall balance. Also, the treatment of the Kens raised some concerns and left room for improvement.In conclusion, \"Barbie\" tackles an important and relevant issue, but it could have been executed more effectively.

In the real world, they see what impact Barbie has, or fails to have, as a product on the minds of young girl consumers. This information changes her, and Ken's opinion of themselves and they return home and deal with the aftermath of this revelation.Barbie is well played by Margot Robbie who is an excellent actress and is perfectly cast in the role.

Hence the movie's staggering $1.4 billion box office return. Not every creative decision functioned to the film's benefit, but the project as a whole felt genuine and fluid. The steady stream of comedy, provided primarily by Will Ferrell, the Mattel CEO and the film's main antagonist, also worked nicely to balance the tone and add a bit of levity.

What happened next was just annoying and confusing. I\\'m saying this as a 26-year-old woman. There were endless speeches about how hard it is to be a woman and a mother.

              "  'Greta Gerwig\\'s blockbuster behemoth \"Barbie\" has been called many things, both praised and beaten to the ground. But it\\'s neither a masterpiece, nor as vile as some detractors claim. Instead, it\\'s one of the most original blockbusters in decades and that is definitely something.Because this is such a big movie, there have been many criticisms even from established and legendary directors. Great filmmakers were quick to criticize its silliness. And while I agree that Barbie\\'s political message is pushed at an intimidating level, is its silliness that makes it work. I have always argued that one of the greatest traits of pop culture is its relentless sense of humor--if it\\'s also backed up by intelligence.And \"Barbie\" is an intelligent movie, no doubt. However, while its feminist stance is well-researched and makes some good points, it\\'s also pushed way too hard, hitting the brakes hard on its potentially great pacing and fun feel. Plus, its parody of toxic masculinity is already well-established through its plot and structure, so this preachy way of doubling down its message explicitly feels redundant. Not to mention that one of the greatest points the movie makes is seen rather than heard.Greta Garwig and her co-writer Noah Baumbach know not to beat the same militant drum so they are not afraid to point out how women themselves also have their part of the blame for their situation as well. For instance, when Ryan Gosling\\'s Ken takes control of Barbie World and turns it into his own \"mojo dojo casa house\", the other Barbies actually enjoy playing server to him and his himbos. It\\'s this collective Stockholm-like Syndrome that is a big part of the problem. The message is clear: it\\'s up to you to take your destiny into your own hands and stand up for yourself because no one else would. This, I believe, is the truest message of \"Barbie\" but is one which unfortunately lies beyond unnecessary antagonistic political muck.Speaking of Ryan Gosling, as much as Margot Robbie\\'s protagonist Barbie is a perfect cast, is Gosling\\'s Ken who steals the entire movie. Arguably the best performance of his career, it also reminded me just not what a great comedic actor he is, but also an unlikely one. Comedy is often physical, as we find a lot of humor in imperfect bodies. Think of the great Charlie Chaplin\\'s diminutive stature and square moustache, and how about Laurel and Hardy! But Gosling manages to be funny while also looking like a Greek sculpture. The way he plays Ken like a big macho doofus with nothing between his ears is top tier entertainment.In the end, \"Barbie\" has been labeled as many things. But while is nowhere near a great movie, it\\'s great entertainment. Between Will Ferrell\\'s Mattel CEO claiming he\\'s a man of the people just because some of his friends are Jewish and a John Cena cameo dressed as a mermaid with really fake hair, this is a blast. And while I advise you to be aware of its politics, try not to get bogged down in them too much even if Gerwig insists upon it.',\n",
              "  \"This movie was supposed to be fun light hearted watch but turns into an obnoxious headache filled with political message on and on and on.The only Relief is honestly Ryan Gosling's Ken who made me crack up multiple times, and he lives as Ken to be honest; there is no Ryan Gosling anymore it's just Ken and he was the protagonist for me.They really show men as cowardly, stupid, needy, power hungry and so on and on. When they showed the real world they could have shown the good and bads parts of it but only the so called patriarchy was shown; like come on. As if it's not already clear for us as audience that all men are horrible and mistreats women we are treated with many monologues of feminism. You would at least think they would go for true equal rights(the thing which actual feminists used to fight for) at the very end but Nooo! The men get satisfied with just 1 seat in that institution instead of it being half and half.\",\n",

A soundtrack that will take you from laughing to crying (yes, very musical moments, after all it is a Barbie movie), in addition to the hand-picked cast, Margot is impeccable and manages to express all her feelings, just with her eyes. Greta's direction and screenplay, just amazing, strong, emotional, empowering and very, very feminist, not only for the women who are already fighting for the cause, but to open everyone's eyes to a sisterhood.\",\n",

Actress is long run better.the movie concept is good women deserve rights too! I definitely didn't expect the Barbie movie to be a cinematic triumph for women everywhere, but here we are..Never smiled so hard for so long, I'm serious. I liked the acting of actress when her feet became flat. Greta is deconstructing Barbie, Capitalism, Gender, all the usual stuff, but she also graciously has the guts to link it all back to identity.\",\n",
              "  \"Watching Greta Gerwig's interpretation of womanhood through universal icon, Barbie, was a beautiful and uniting experience.This movie celebrates the transition from girlhood to womanhood, as well as the universal experience of just existing in this day and age.Not to mention the filming techniques used to film alongside the soundtrack and even the cast made the movie feel like a trip back to playtime in childhood.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have so much on screen chemistry that makes the movie feel fluid and fun, and the insanely diverse cast of both Barbies and Kens was an astounding and commendable casting choice.Barbie is definitely Oscar worthy, and represents something much more than a doll.\",\n",
              "  \"The Kubrick-inspired intro was unexpected but definitely appreciated. It's a funny movie. It's got quirky and clever humor. I like how it kind of makes fun of itself as well, it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's very self aware humor. It's also silly without being annoying or repetitive. This movie is very creative and imaginative. It was a very well made movie where they paid a lot of attention to detail. Especially with all the set pieces, costumes and props. It's cool to see them bring the Barbie universe to life in live action. There's some cameos in this movie that were hilarious. Margot was wonderful as Barbie. Michael Cera as Alan was perfect. I love the guy, great and funny actor. Ryan Gosling kills it as Ken. He's got a great understanding of comedy. Kate McKinnon as weird Barbie was so good, she's hilarious. Everybody plays their part wonderfully. The movie's very colorful, warm and bright. It inspires feelings of happiness and joy. It's a very feel-good type of vibe. There's a standout moment for me when Barbie's sitting on a bench and looks around her and realizes that the imperfect real world is actually a beautiful world. With all of it's good and bad, happy and sad.Ok, now onto the bad lol. So the movie starts out really fun and funny but then gets progressively more and more preachy. The movie starts out at an 8/10 then midway through drops to a 7, by the end it goes down to a 6. It kind of takes a nosedive around the end when it becomes overly preachy with it's speeches and confusing messages. By this point I pretty much tuned out and started asking myself what the creators true intentions were and what messages they were trying to convey. I feel like the moral/message of the movie gets kind of muddled and isn't as transparent as it should be.Obviously the movie is about self discovery, identity and female empowerment but when it comes to the whole male/female subject matter, it gets confusing. Are men the evil ones, the bad ones? And women are the victims of mens patriarchy? I mean if that's the case, then the creators of this movie are completely out of touch with reality. Look at all the rights and equality women have nowadays. Look at all the women in power. All the women who own businesses, who are go-getters, who are successful entrepreneurs. This movie makes it out to seem like women are powerless, oppressed by men and the only way to get ahead is through manipulation and psychological tactics lol. It's almost offensive. I feel like the moral/message gets lost within the movie and this is its main problem.Other than that, it's a feel-good hilarious fun time!\",\n",

It is definitely one of the funniest I've seen in at least 2 years, it has a simple storyline that works exactly as it suppose to without trying to be something else. The message is powerful and easy to understand, I found it refreshing and truthful, sometimes it may feel even a bit naive, but in the end it is what it is and I appreciated that. The performances are really delightful and full of small nuances that make them easy to connect with, even though the tone is satiric and farcical. Great movie, a lot more than I expected.\",\n",
              "  '7-8/10 range. I was thinking 7.5? 7.8? But it lacks what I would look for to give it an 8. Anyways, the breakdown:Visual Aesthetics:\\nFirst of all, whoever worked on the design for the set did a stellar job. Costumes, Colour Schemes, Make-up, Stage Design -- these were all excellent.Acting and character scripts:\\nThe leads did a fantastic job with there roles. Margot brings her character to life well, and I guess that\\'s a pun now. Gosling likewise does well with what he has, albeit it feels like we could have gotten more grounding on the Kens as characters.Some of the supporting characters were done a bit, cheesy as well, and felt a bit out of place in the wrong way. Some of this might have been delivery, but again, some of the parts were just not as well fleshed out as they needed to be.If there is an extended version, it might address the grounding on these characters.CEO characters seemed more or less appropriate as caricatures.Creator was a nice character.Overarching theme and plot:The overarching theme is meaningful, I\\'m not 100% certain on the execution and there is some variability between what is meant to be taken as straight forward and tongue in cheek, and that line isn\\'t always clear. I am now talking about my own flaws in communication ;) anyways, there was a little bit of a sense of wondering where the film was trying to go exactly in terms of direction in the larger execution.The bringing in of the creator of Barbies was a brilliant conclusion which was well executed.Overall, the execution didn\\'t quite hit the notes I was looking for, but did a fine job. I have no strong explicit complaints, but just feel more concise direction on the placement of certain lines might have benefitted the cohesive expression when looking at all levels of the story.Sountrack:\\nMusic was well matched and did not detract. Some of the effects were a little over-used, and more daring could have been added for some scenes, but the overall main themes were a good compliment.Overall,\\nIt was a worthwhile watch to see how this actually turned out. This film has been caught in a media firestorm because it deals with feminism and the topic of equal rights. Equal rights are not achieved in the film, but it does highlight the topic. Some viewers feel that it was \"too heavy handed\" which I can see why some scenes were a bit corny or expositive, however, not anywhere near to the level conservative critics have been complaining about this film. You\\'d think this film were sacrificing Jesus or Hitler. For the most part, things were handled in a reasonable way, and moreso considering the limitations for time and budget.That said, my least favourite scenes were some of the LA scenes. Perhaps it\\'s bad memories of Venice Beach being Venice Beach, or maybe it was the camera angles.Overall,\\nDefinitely worth a watch. Doesn\\'t live up 100% to the hype, but definitely not remotely the same movie other \"critics\" have been claiming it to be.7.5-7.8 ish. Decent, some great aspects, some okay aspects, some cheesy aspects.Some more grounding on some scenes and characters, and a little less cheesiness in some spots and I feel it could have easily gotten to an 8+.',\n",
              "  'I thought the storyline of this movie was not well structured. The first act was mostly fun with some genuine humor. We see Barbie living in a world that looks like the toys brought to life. When she decides to go to the \"real world,\" it disrupts life for the residents of toyland. We also learn that many girls resent Barbie dolls because of the unrealistic expectations they set for females. Then, the conflict shifts completely to the male dolls taking over the Barbie world and treating the women poorly. So now there are two competing storylines, and as the characters work to resolve both issues, we get repetitive monologues about finding oneself. It gets very muddled and isn\\'t much fun at this point. I thought they should have kept it simple, because they seemed to be on the right track early on.',\n",

To Barbie she views herself as someone that strives to be able to do anything a man could do and to her she thought that mirrored to the real world. The movie fights against the double standards women have themselves and about understanding yourself as an individual. To me, the most touching part was the end when it shows clips of women just laughing and enjoying themselves and I felt it had such a deep message to be proud that I am a woman. It also referenced how just because toy Ken is an accessory to Barbie that doesn't have to be his only personality trait which I believed showed a great way of presenting the film was not only about women's explorations and feelings but men's as well.\",\n",

Then something strange happened about half way through: it got all serious and made Ken a baddie and then decided to preach to us about the injustices that women have endured (which I agree to be true, but didn't fit where I thought this movie was going).Not quite sure who this movie was intended for, but I walked out disappointed. The males all ended up being either bad or stupid, or both. Not sure if this is a film that the great Will Ferrell can hold his head up high for as his role served very little purpose.The acting and cinematography saved it.\",\n",

There\\'s heartfelt messaging at the curtain closing, but it very much straddles the fence between traditional conservative womanhood and progressive girl boss \"smash the patriarchy\".Speaking of patriarchy, this film drops the p-word countless times. And the image of masculinity is confusing, is Ken masculine or campy and confused? Horse obsessed, gym bro, with a passion for theatrics and fur coats - traditional masculine, doubtful.I don\\'t know who this film was made for, or where it stands on anything.

              "  'Margot Robbie had a vision, and she was the driving force to get the Barbie movie produced by none other than world-class director Greta Gerwig.The beginning of the movie brings us back to the first trailers for the movie, when little girls discovered a new doll, the first Barbie. She was different than any other doll because she was not a baby-doll, no, she was a woman-doll; a doll which could inspire the imagination and aspiration of children.Margot Robbie plays the main character \"stereotypical Babie\" and brings her to life in every detail and introduces us to Barbieworld with all her friends. The perfect repeated \"best day every day\" gets disrupted by unknown circumstances and \"stereotypical Barbie\" accompanied by \"her\" Ken, portrayed by Ryan Gosling go on an adventure of their lifetime to the \"real world\". The discoveries and experiences that these two make have major impacts in both worlds.This movie is worthwhile watching for the costumes and displays as much as for the social criticism of our time. The words of Gloria\\'s (America Ferrera) speech hit the nail on its head regarding the daily struggles of women in our modern world. This movie is a depiction of reality and a dream world. It shows the possibilities as much as the shortcomings of our times with humor and fun, a little bit of sarcasm, paired with the innocence of someone new to our reality!Highly recommended for everyone who is not too shy to face real world struggle in a pink coated Barbie world.',\n",

It's a good movie.I steer clear of as much film promo as possible, so was kinda expecting this to be more of a 'proper' comedy - just an assumption on my part. It does have humour but it's far from the film's main thing, there are a few chucklesome moments but I found it to be more earnest than funny.It does get a tiny bit moralistic, though undoubtedly has the right intentions and does certainly hit the nail on the head with certain points. The story itself is interesting, I like that they didn't lean deep into the usual fish out of water stuff when Barbie visits the real world. I enjoy how the world is set, with the multiple Barbies and Kens etc.The cast are great. Margot Robbie is top notch - the perfect choice. Ryan Gosling is excellent as well, while America Ferrera, Will Ferrell and Michael Cera are positives too. Away from those onscreen, the look of the film is splendid and the soundtrack fits well - even if Charli XCX's track is the only one I'd intentionally listen to.All in all, glad I watched this. I'd recommend it, even if my mum (who I watched this with, fwiw) wouldn't. üòÑ\",\n",
              "  'This is a film that should not have worked. It wants to go from goofy, to serious, to moralistic, to sentimental, all at once. Which is similar to the multi-tone \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\". Both movies try to juggle different tones and themes and both succeed for the most part. One thing Barbie has going in its favour is that it knows its limitations and mercifully clocks in less than two hours. The script explores many aspects of the aura of the Barbie doll and its legacy. This is a fresh topic that alone provides interesting insight. An original premise in the world of cookie-cutter franchise sequels. Both the positive and negative aspects of what the Barbie doll represents is addressed without holding back. Amazingly, even the Mattel corporation itself is lampooned. So the script is not only allowed to address less popular characteristics about the doll, but finds real insight about what Barbie and Ken represent to young kids compared the more mature adult world.But a script normally can\\'t have its cake and eat it to. It\\'s a lighthearted trip into Barbieland, but also finds true sadness in how we give up our active imagination once we get older, and the need to be serious about the real world. Not only that, but it delivers straight forward lessons about a male dominated society and how woman are rarely given positions of power. Give credit to co-writer and director Greta Gerwig for mastering all things Barbie, sticking it all in a blender, and making a cohesive piece of work that transcends expectations for a movie based on a toy doll. Give credit to the powers that be that took a chance on such an unlikely hit movie and keeps the narrative moving along in engaging and unpredictable ways.Not that one could make this movie with other actors in the lead roles, but the persona and especially the physical likeness of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling seem to be a perfect match. Robbie especially brings a heartfelt sadness in a couple of scenes that make her character more than one dimensional, despite being based on a plastic doll. Gosling brings his lighthearted personality to the role of Ken convincingly, yet allowing the one dimensional character to wish for a sense of belonging.I also really enjoyed how the script made comparisons of the plastic world of Barbie and Ken to the plastic lifestyles of the uber rich in LA. When watching scenes of Barbie & Ken hitting it off, I could see Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce in their place. The production feels like a big Hollywood musical. Large sets with large scale musical numbers. But yet they have an avant garde feel to them, as if it was a Tim Burton film, or maybe a fantasy scene from a Coen brothers movie. The hundreds of props littered throughout the film also provide meaning as they are symbols of the masculine and feminine mystique.Barbie the movie is a surprising existential essay that finds meaning behind the plastic. The script achieves in its quest to draw interest from the average moviegoer by revealing how much of the Barbie world lives within us.',\n",

Never played with Barbies but my daughter did. Tribute to the inventor of Barbie, Ruth Handler. Helen Mirren narrates. Kate McKinnon almost steals the movie. Not a movie for little kids but most of the references will probably go over their heads. My girlfriend and I laughed out loud many times. It's about 20 minutes too long for my taste. The music is spot on. It's a perfect summer movie. Guess what? It has value and substance. Margot Robbie is not only gorgeous but more importantly, she's highly intelligent as actor and producer.

He isn't afraid of showing himself up.It's well written and has something to say. It's also well shot and designed.Even Will Ferrell is good, though he's in a supporting role, so that helps!Out of all the summer blockbusters this year, this is the winner- and yes it's better than Oppenheimer!I could watch it again, something I couldn't do with aforementioned film.\",\n",
              "  'Greta Gerwig, took the most famous doll of humanity, a luxury cast and made a good film with an important message!Barbie offers almost 120 minutes of fun, captivating and fluid moments. Mixing real elements with \"drawn\" scenarios, it manages to bring the two worlds together in a balanced and intelligent way, varying between \"cartoons\" and the real world.It also shows in a very intelligent way all the difficulties that women go through in their lives, such as the lack of respect for their intellectual and physical property, as well as illustrating a series of moments that illustrate patriarchy and the disrespectful way in which many men treat women and think they are superior based on their gender. A message that Ryan Gosling had in a great performance to emphasize the perspective that unfortunately still reigns in many men today.Speaking of the cast, Ryan Gosling had a script that favored him, with several scenes and different roles that allowed him to show all his versatility as an actor, and the reality is that he delivered a high-level performance, the best in the film imo, and that he managed not only to give strength to the message that he wanted to convey, but also to elevate the film to another level with his musical performances. On the other hand, imo, Margot had a script that didn\\'t exploit all of his acting skills. Don\\'t get me wrong, her acting is very good, within what was provided, the performance is very good, however I think the script could have given her more, due to the versatility she has!And my first negative point is precisely that. The script was too attached to the message it wanted to convey and did not use all the potential that \"Barbie\" provided, such as the affective side and its overall positive impact on many women. Furthermore, the focus on the concept limited the development of characters and a cast that had more to offer!The dialogues also suffer from a lot of fluctuations, the good dialogues are really good but seem very disconnected from the rest, as the construction even them felt lazy. It\\'s as if they didn\\'t connect to what just happened in the last few minutes and just came out of nowhere. It\\'s a shame, because there are really good speeches!Finally, the message got across clearly and the most important thing is clearly retained. This movie was never about pink or a doll. It was about women and the rights they are due! Respect, freedom, and justice in relation to the opportunities they should have. Doors should open according to the work carried out and the skills demonstrated, never to the gender or color of a person! Love is love no matters what. Respect is to everyone, there\\'s no \"but\"! However, I think Greta missed an incredible opportunity to make a stronger \"statement\" about equal rights, duties and opportunities for all!In short, it\\'s a good film, light, funny and entertaining, and can be watched several times as something to \"pass the time and have fun\" but should be watched, at least once, in a serious and dedicated way for all the message it has!',\n",

              "  'What a film! I was ecstatic about seeing Barbie and it definitely exceeded my expectations by far. As much as I was excited, I was a bit scared that the stakes were too high; after all Barbie is an icon and a part of so many people\\'s childhood. For a film like this it\\'s very easy to create something corny, disappointing, or unappealing to viewers. I\\'m so glad that Gretta Gerwig stepped up to the plate and created an absolute masterpiece.The film starts with showing the origin of Barbie in 1959. It explains how little girls used to play with baby dolls and commonly acted as their mothers, but wanted a doll that they could really play with instead of taking care of. And that\\'s how Barbie came about. Then we see the beautiful Barbie world where every Barbie is a part of something. We see Barbie doctors, Barbie novelists, Barbie astronauts, Barbie everything! And in Barbie\\'s world every day is perfect. The star of the show Margot Robbie plays \"Stereotypical Barbie\" and she starts to notice strange things happening to her. She has to visit the real world to see who was playing with her to discover why these strange things are happening. The rest of the film is about Barbie trying to find herself and discovering scary aspects of the real world that she was blinded by before.There was so much love put into this film and you can really see that on screen. The comedy in this film is so on point that the whole theater was laughing when I went to see this film. Huge kudos to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, writers of this incredible screenplay. The script is pure genius; I love how the film really honors Barbie and what she was made for. The cast of this film is exceptional. Margot Robbie was originally producing the film until she was cast as Barbie. Margot is the perfect Barbie; she plays this role so well she is like a real-life Barbie on screen. The way she embodies Barbie is just so perfect. I was really excited to see Ryan Gosling as Ken since he\\'s one of my favorite actors. There\\'s a lot of controversy as to why Ryan Gosling was cast as Ken but he makes perfect sense. He plays Ken so well he really nails what it means to be Ken in this film. America Ferrera plays a Mom named Gloria and she is such an interesting character. She plays a mom who\\'s going through struggles of just being a woman and I\\'m sure her character will speak to so many mothers. It would be a crime to not talk about the insane set. Funny enough, Greta Gerwig used so much pink paint for this set that it actually drained an entire company\\'s supply. The Barbie world is exactly as you\\'d expect it -- from Barbie dream-houses to Barbie beaches -- everything looks like it came right out of a toy store. Rodrigo Prieto shot this film and the cinematography is extraordinary. As someone who grew up with Barbie, this film really speaks to me. I am in love with the score of this film. Billie Eilish\\'s \"What was I made for\" is one of the most beautiful songs I\\'ve heard. This film is packed with so many great artists like Tame Impalla, Lizzo, Dua Lipa and many others.The film is packed with so many messages. I was surprised with how many topics this film covers -- what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a mother, what it\\'s like to grow up in today\\'s society, what is love, and so much more. This film is a celebration of women and girlhood but I also love how it represents men. Ken is discovering how men are viewed in today\\'s society in a similar way to how Barbie is discovering who she is.I give Barbie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults.

The character arch of Ken (Ryan Gosling) was is most enjoyable for me, he is the real star of this film. I felt the heavy anti-patriarchy angle for Barbie (Margot Robbie) was a bit ham-fisted.I will say that they couldn't of picked a better person to play Barbie, Margot Robbie just encapsulates the over-the-top nature, 'perfect look' and clueless attitude that we expect from Barbie.The only jokes I laughed at were either from Ken or Weird Barbie, I would say 90% were Ken. This isn't a bad thing more of a lack of interesting and funny characters.The cinematography and settings are amazing and stunning to look at.

At the same time, the movie seems like a sketch from a talkshow that parodies cliches associated with the Barbie subculture.All the most important things happen towards the end, when Barbie faces a dilemma on a universal scale: to remain a doll in an ideal doll world or to become a real (\"ordinary\") person. There is no single correct choice here. You either live in a delusional bliss or face the harsh reality.In general, the impression of the film can be expressed in a phrase: they wanted to say a lot of things at once, but along the way they also got lost in their grandiose attempt at philosophy. Nevertheless, the film turned out to be funny. Adults will enjoy reading the philosophical ideas hidden here. And for children there is a bright, dynamic story and several smart ideas presented in understandable language.',\n",

Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie and she made a great movie even better.Someone asked why a 60+ adult female like me would go to see this kids movie.For me, Barbie was such a huge part of my childhood. Playing \"Barbs\" with my best friend as a young girl is one of my most cherished memories. It was something just for girls when we were mostly excluded from being in any lead role in the world (our moms, aunts, grandma\\'s were excluded too). No sports, few female leads in film or television, few jobs outside of the pink collar ghetto we were kept in. Barbie was beautiful and the center of her own story. For this reason I had to go on opening weekend to vote for the world of Barbie, to say,\\nthank you.',\n",

Is it perfect, no some jokes don't land, but the performances sell the show. Margot Robbie as the titular Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken are also stellar. The production design is also a marvel to look out, with Barbieland feeling real and lived in with bright pink everywhere. But it also feels like a surface - level understanding of feminism, with it not going deep on why women struggle so much more than men do. The film acknowledges it for a second, but then quickly moves away from it so they can go on a fun little chase or show Will Ferrell be a goofball for a bit.\",\n",

It's not perfect, and I feel the messaging at times was too blunt, but the elements of the movie that were silly and enjoyable balanced it outPros:\\n1) best part of the movie is the soundtrack. I really liked it and the song by Billie Eilish that they played at the end has been replaying in my head ever since\\n2) the cast is also really good. Robbie and Gosling fit the roles perfectly and did a good job of adding layers to otherwise one-dimensional characters\\n3) the writing was generally pretty good, and there were several scenes that I feel like packed a decent emotional punchCons:\\n1) probably my biggest con is that the movie isn't very funny. It's written like it should be a comedy; it's silly, it's fun, and it's entertaining, but the jokes aren't that great. Even though the theatre was full, the audience was very quiet during some of the jokes. For example, Will Ferrell tried very hard, but the role he played didn't really have any good jokes to work with. The movie leaned into the silliness of its world, but seemed afraid to lean into the silliness enough in order to make a truly funny film.\",\n",

Unfortunately, there was so much exposition going on throughout that I was never really able to go much deeper into the proceedings beyond the visuals. The acting was solid and there were moments of both fun and joy spotted throughout, but sadly for the viewer those were few and far between.

(Nope still don\\'t have anything original or high-quality in this Era of film-making).Most sequences of the film are a collection of \"unbelievable!\" instagram-like moments strung together with a lazy unity that affirms one thing: confusion.This film grossly underestimates the IQ of its audience or lacks the subtly and nuance to pursue the complex arguments regarding its central socio-political themes. It says only so much, afraid at every step to be cancelled but also trying to stand firm in some desperation for truth, to help stand up to that mean Mattel! The same Mattel that Warner Bros (who produced the Barbie film) is partnered with.Margot Robbie tries to give it her all (she can open one eye tear stream with the best of them) but her performance lacks the quiet composure of all struggling with identity issues. It is surely a barbie-rific film! Although even the fake smiles of the actors seem fake, almost as if they are saying, \"I can\\'t believe I am doing this.\" They almost solemnly predict the end of the film before a single ounce of real joy can be seen/had. The entire film is depressing, even where it is supposed to be joyful.There is no great sense of play. It appears everyone is outstandingly self-conscious and hyper aware. Weirdly hyper aware. These aren\\'t artists (with perhaps the exception of Gosling). These are everyday men and women pretending to be actors and absurdly conscious of it. One can only get along with color palettes, explosions, and circus jokes / \"provocative\" one liners for so long. The real attempt at story was shaky at best. Amazingly studios allow Gerwig to direct a high school film project with a 150 million dollar budget and a volunteer casting call of beginning drama students and a few pretty people who always wanted to be in a movie.The long wait gets longer.

Both \"Ken\" and \"Barbie\" made fun of themselves it also had points in it that were referring to some of the stuff going on in today\\'s climate.It was fantastically done with a lot of satire. Even the overly silly stuff made a way to make it somewhat funny. Don\\'t judge this book by the cover you will be highly surprised. So many great actors throughout that added to the film.

Because it juxtaposes a world that was created in the imagination of women (Barbieland) vs. Men (the real world), it has a bit of a devastating conclusion for both: mainly that people struggle to live up to ideals, resulting in feelings of alienation and depression that they try to hide. What I appreciated so much about the movie was its commentary on men feeling like they need a \"Barbie\" at their side to feel successful. It occurred in Barbieland but honestly it was a commentary on both men and women who feel that way in both worlds. It\\'s easier to think that someone else will help us determine why we are here instead of really exploring who we are and what our purpose is as individuals. There\\'s a loneliness that rung so true at the heart of the Ken experience. Curious what men thought of it and if they could relate.Set design and visual humor were awesome. Everyone played their role with a lot of heart. My soon to be 11 year old daughter loved it as well. It was just wonderfully entertaining.',\n",

For example, why did the Mattel board chase barbie into barbieland when what they wanted was for her to go back there and how did the Ken's brainwash intelligent barbies in such a short period of time. Also some of the references were a bit obscure and the end dragged on for at least 10 minutes too long.

              "  \"It's impressive how so many messages were cleverly conveyed through a well-known brand.The movie addressed a range of great themes, skillfully communicated through colors and a cute fairytale-like presentation.-One of the key messages is when Barbie talks to Ken in the end and her words focus mostly on the fact that individuals should find their completeness within themselves before entering a relationship. Exploring personal preferences and self-awareness is vital before projecting unresolved issues onto a partnership. Developing a strong self-relationship is a foundational step before building connections with others.-The movie also transforms the traditional Barbie world to a world where men pursue their interests while Barbies serve them. This shift seems to show the challenge of achieving equality in relationships, highlighting the struggle to establish and maintain balance between feminism and patriarchy.-A particularly touching moment is Barbie creator's monologue. It resonates as an empowerment boost for women who stay in abusive situations due to their lack of self-confidence and fear of taking control of their lives.-The film addresses also how society imposes unrealistic role models, leading to personal dissatisfaction. Barbie has been/still is an example of those models. However, if our real lives start being reflected into the doll, we will notice how miserable and depressing we all are.It's sad to see negative reviews for this impactful attempt that managed to encapsulate these messages.\",\n",

It pretty much all felt like a fever dream, but in a good way. It also contained some jokes that were definitely for the adult/young-adult audience, but they were okay for teens like myself and the friend group i went with. Like, Barbie casually drops the word 'vagina' and Ken is talking about his genitals in a non-direct way, but the intention was still there. Some jokes landed pretty flat, but the big majority was very fun. Also the word 'patriarchy' was used way too many times by Ken (Ryan Gosling) and it felt almost annoying. The movie featured songs by the artists: Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj and unfortunately Ice Spice. The soundtrack was absolutely incredible, maybe exept Ice Spice's song that was only heard at the credit roll, right at the end. We all know the movie was carried by the amazing Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but I'd say Kate McKinnon's caracter and acting\\nIn conclusion this is a pretty good movie, and if you have the opportunity you should watch it.\",\n",

That should be impossible, but Gerwig nails it in many ways. Not everything worked for me, but not everything works for me in any comedy. Overall, they told a story about a toy which I have no attachment to (and at points would have described as problematic), and totally sucked me in. And based on the theater's reaction around me, I wasn't alone.\",\n",
              "  '\"Barbie (2023)\" attempted to mold a modern narrative around the iconic doll, but what unraveled was a feature film that was as plastic and hollow as the toy it\\'s inspired by. The film sets forth with a glittery promise of self-discovery and empowerment but stumbles and falls face-first into a puddle of clich√©s and superficiality.The protagonist\\'s journey from a boxed perfection to a self-realized individual is filled with predictable plot twists and eye-roll-inducing dialogues. The script seems to be churned out from a factory of trite, lacking any originality or depth, much like the molded plastic of a Barbie doll.The animation, touted as one of the highlights, is nothing more than a barrage of pastel colors and unrealistic body proportions. It fails to breathe life into the characters or the world around them, making it a plastic paradise devoid of any genuine emotion or relatability.Supporting characters are as one-dimensional as they come, each embodying a blatant stereotype without any redeeming qualities. They flutter through the scenes, contributing nothing to the narrative other than filling the already cluttered screen.The attempt to modernize Barbie and make her relatable to the contemporary audience is a lost cause as the essence of what makes Barbie iconic is buried under a heap of modern-day jargon and misplaced attempts at humor.The villain, a caricature of societal expectations, is as menacing as a bubble wrap, failing to evoke any real threat or concern.Barbie is a missed opportunity to delve into the evolving identity and societal expectations of women. Instead, it serves a shallow, glitter-coated narrative that\\'s as fleeting and forgettable as a fashion trend. In trying to find Barbie\\'s place in the modern world, the film loses its way and ends up being a lackluster parade of plasticity.',\n",
              "  'I think part of my brain rejects this for being a feature-length toy commercial, but it\\'s a very small part of my brain (and that really wasn\\'t where my mind was for the majority of the movie).Overall, it\\'s probably about as good as an official live-action Barbie movie could ever be, with Greta Gerwig clearly given plenty of freedom to have fun with a property/movie like this. It\\'s bigger in scale than her previous two films (Ladybird and Little Women, both of which I prefer to this by a little), and the scale and creativity of the film really kept the momentum going. It\\'s very funny in parts, and though I guess it\\'s sort of a kid-friendly movie, there are tons of jokes and references that\\'ll go over the heads of younger kids. \"What\\'s a fascist?\" is something I heard a four-year-old ask one of their parents halfway through the movie, and that in itself was kind of funny to hear.Margot Robbie is good as always, and is given a surprising amount to do emotionally. It is Barbie\\'s movie, but Ryan Gosling\\'s Ken often steals the film whenever he\\'s on-screen (as the film\\'s wrapping up, there\\'s a fairly awkward pivot to \"oh yeah, this is Barbie\\'s movie;\" it\\'s even addressed in dialogue). I don\\'t think that\\'s a problem, because he\\'s hilarious - it might be one of the best performances he\\'s ever given. I also don\\'t think his character is used \"just\" to attack men, the way I imagine some people will read into it. Barbie does the most learning and has the biggest character arc, sure, but Ken goes through one too, and I thought they wrapped up that side of things nicely.It\\'s an enjoyable movie that deals with some hefty topics (namedropping plenty of words younger kids won\\'t have even heard before) in a mostly consistent way. Some tonal shifts are jarring, and while the vast majority of jokes land, I don\\'t think all did. It does also feel a bit too directly like a commercial at a couple of points, especially early on, but I did expect that. And it\\'s a testament to the quality of the movie that me and all my anti-consumerist thoughts didn\\'t overpower my mind throughout most of this.',\n",
              "  'I thought Barbie was an ok movie, especially by recent standards. It was a whimsical, borderline funny movie that presented both femininity and masculinity in both toxic and healthy versions. Part of the movie that isn\\'t brought up much is that during the first few minutes, Barbie World, which is completely matriarchal, is shallow and plastic. Life in Barbie World is boring. Which is why after Ken brings the patriarchy from the real world almost everyone is on board. It\\'s different and fun. Then when Barbie returns, Barbie and a couple of others use deception and manipulation to win back power. Just like some aspects (some, not all) of the patriarchy, deception and manipulation are evil too. Then after Barbie finally sees Ken\\'s dilemma, instead of only focusing on herself, she supports him. It\\'s Barbie and its Ken. The message of the movie is not down with the patriarchy, nor is it anti matriarchy. The message of the movie is life is hard, with ups and downs and then you die, so we should support each other. Just like how some women see sexism everywhere or how some nonwhites see racism everywhere; I think the prevalence of anti-male propaganda in modern \"entertainment\" has led some people to see male bashing everywhere. I think this movie was balanced in its fault finding and the core message was to support each other.',\n",

I was taken aback with the 2001 opening, since I have a personal aversion to seeing toys get destroyed, but then it starts to unfold.And what we have is a combination of The Twilight Zone and 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.It really focuses in on one Barbie (Margot Robbie) who finds herself out of her element, and her struggle to comes to terms with herself. Though the film has some weirdness to it, it sets us up for the second half of the film which really shines.And its messages pack a wallop!!!The casting is top notch, starting with Ms. Robbie in the title role. Ryan Gosling also delivers a fantastic performance as well, with a wide range. But one actress truly deserves a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, and that is America Ferrara. The other performers are likewise great!I'm also struck by how Mattel allowed itself to be show in a fantasy way that isn't always flattering. And toward the end, we have the Barbie doll's creator, Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman) tell Ms. Robbie's character some facts about herself that are less than flattering. That scene alone is incredibly powerful.And of course, the visuals are something to behold!On the whole, a truly incredible film that has a lot of originality! Highly recommended!\",\n",

It is a little funny, if you want, you can think about the Barbie cult, but the movie is not phylosophical drama..If you are just bored and need something in the backgroud, but the movie can not please every viewer.

The ending made me cry but in such a good way, like how Barbie was when she experienced sadness for the first time. Seeing a movie that doesn't have the patriarchy spreader all over it is so refreshing, and honestly, if you're mad at this movie, you might be part of the problem. Seeing Ruth appear and give Barbie a talk was so amazing and such an emotional experience. I loved it so much I can't even explain. Seeing women even in movies come together and address problems is so refreshing.When the mom gave the speech about being a mom and a woman was so amazing and it had such a good message written into it.And can we talk about how well Will Ferrell played his role? And don't even get me started on Margot's acting. Literally amazing, she played her role so wellThis movie was a cinematic masterpiece to say nothing more. At the end when Barbie said her name (Barbara) was so amazing because she was originally named after Ruth's daughter, I loved that so much.And honestly I think that everybody needs to see this movie, no matter what your standpoint on life is, everyone needs to see this movie.And seeing a movie describe and mention how harmful the patriarchy is in such a funny way was absolutely amazing.

It reminded me to think outside of myself and consider our world. I believe we all have some Barbie or Ken in us and well if we remember that maybe this world would be a better place.

It is however 100% targeted at women, I'd say middle aged since that was the majority of the theater and the topics not really suitable for young girls.I do wonder if it was a bit harsh on men as it did lean way too much into He vs She debate in the second half.Margot Robbie was amazing as Barbie but Ryan Gosling very much stole the show.

Kidding). What the film offers is a lot of comedy which movie viewers will likely to enjoy. It pays homage to the different types of Barbie dolls but that depressed and ordinary Barbie were the best in this film. With Barbie, there comes Ken and Alan? But Ken was not sidelined in this film. In fact, I kinda felt more empathy on Ken\\'s side than on Barbie\\'s. Yeah this is a film based on Barbie who of course we know that without Barbie, there won\\'t be a Ken. However, this film shows its viewers that it shouldn\\'t be that way. Ken is as important as Barbie. On the other hand, that speech of \"Gloria\" was really moving and very inspiring.This film takes us to a world where toys and humans interact. Where those who live in a cycle can break the chain and have a decision to make. Where every individual has a choice and every person in this world is as important as the other.Barbie is 7/10. Enjoyable, fun for family however as my friend have said, there were scenes in this film that felt like \"what\\'s next?\" or some parts felt like fillers. Still, it was enjoyable and a good film.On the side note, Greta Gerwig, PLEASE DO WELL ON NARNIA ADAPTATIONS. In the meantime, where to buy that \"I am Kenough\" shirt?',\n",

Both of them are great, I will tell you why this movie is great, but the main point is that you can't just compare this two movies. Anyway, Greta Gerwig did an absolutely amazing job, and I was so surprised over how deep and emotional this movie really was. This is not made for kids, even if you could think this would be for kids, but no. Some sexual humor and a very complex moral that not every child would understand. The good things about Barbie is the valuable moral itself. They show you that the world and humanity, isn't perfect, and it is never going to be perfect, you just have to focus on how you are now. They showed how women were treated in centuries, and the big pressure on men and how they have to be in front of women, strong, reckless and to never show their feelings. That is something I wouldn't expect from this movie, I was very surprised, and the representation of men, Ken (Just Ken) as the main Ken played be Ryan Gosling, he did just an amazing job at showing how men are and their behaviour. Margot Robbie was the second big star, or the first, both of them were amazing, but she played with such a feeling and emotion. When Barbie, the main Barbie played by Margot, discovered that the world and the people in the world are not perfect, and that not everyone are like her, she was completely off. Margot Robbie showed that feeling in the exactly good way as it should be showed in. Besides the actors, the storytelling, scenography and music soundtrack was amazing. Sometimes it was a bit too much screaming, but that's not the point, this movie was awesome! This is a movie for everyone. If you like Barbie, this movie is for you, if you don't like Barbie, this movie is for you. This is a movie made for everyone, everyone can enjoy it, and I can't really understand why so many countries made this movie forbidden. This movie offers you so much moral, entertainment, and I think this was a great movie.\",\n",

It\\'s built exactly like a child\\'s imagination with incredible set designs and quirky mechanics. The first thirty minutes are fun and filled with music and bright colours. The dance sequences brings me back to my childhood where I would create these kinds of scenes with my toys. I wish we could have stayed in this wonderland a bit longer before we had to get to the real world.Ryan Gossling stole the show. I don\\'t remember the last time I laughed so much. It was iconic how Gerwig reversed the narrative and made Ken into the typical representation of women in film. The film is so clever and is clearly made by someone that is a student of film. With references of Space Odessey, the Matrix, The Truman Show, The Wizard of Oz, and hundreds of others, it made the film have that much more depth.I feel like the plot could have been rearranged a bit. The quests Barbie is supposed to solve seems irrelevant to me. It offers comic relief, but I believe it would have been more pertinent to have her explore the real world to see how Barbies \"saved\" us. The mom and daughter character are useless to the narrative. Other than having 0 personality or depth, we never got to understand their tension or learn their drives. They could have been better written, or removed all together. The monologue sequence was a mistake. Show me how women live in this world instead of telling me. It sounded too preachy for me, despite me being a feminist. If we would have spent less time on the mother and daughter, and more on giving concrete examples of women\\'s pressure, it would have been a stronger film.The story and characterization is also lacking at Mattel. We never get a conclusion to why Mattel went back to Barbieland. The story felt incomplete, and perhaps overly cut due to corporate producers. This brings me to argue that we didn\\'t receive the movie that was intended by the director. Although it being a critique on our society and the impossible standards for women, it could have been pushed even further. Perhaps the large presence of corporate players like Mattel and Chevrolet hindered the extent of the satire. I was expecting a Kubrick kind of satire, and as much as we did get some of that, more subtle satire could have been beneficial. I have full confidence in Gerwig\\'s skills which is why I\\'d be curious to see a directors cut. Let\\'s petition for it!The ending was also disappointing for me. I felt like I was watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 for no apparent reason. Perhaps they didn\\'t really know where to go with the story and I\\'m shocked they chose that. I liked that we got to meet the creator of Barbie, but there was something missing for me. Overall, this was a fun time. I think most audiences will enjoy this despite having some plot holes.

The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching.',\n",

The one problem is that it is so catered to women that the men watching literally just don't understand.

Perfection in Barbie land doesn't last long though, as Barbie must travel to the real world to solve her sudden existential crisis. She meets both friends and foes along the way.As Barbie and her new girl gang return to Barbie Land, they are horrified to see that it is now renamed 'Kendom', after Ken (Ryan Gosling) who initially tagged along with Barbie has discovered the patriarchy of the real world and wants to be seen as more than 'just Ken'.With a star-studded cast full of cameos, Barbie's Margot Robbie is stunning, and I think the perfect choice for the title role. On a side note, it was nice to hear her not doing a Boston/New York accent for once. Ryan Gosling however took me out of the Ken fantasy. Character-wise he was great, but I see Ken as more of a Travis Van Winkle or Trevor Donovan type. Goslings' portrayal of Ken looked a bit sleazy, and the bleach-blonde hair did him no favours.There is a lot of lore and fun easter eggs throughout the film that both young and old can recognize, and even if you don't have a history of playing with Barbies (which I cannot confirm or deny that I did), there is a sense of nostalgia too.Bonus points for the phenomenal set and costume design, and a killer soundtrack too!

I suppose I\\'d thought that it would be too juvenile and aimed at teens and tweens, but actually it was very good and the more I recalled of it, the more I wanted to see it again.There was so much nostalgia throughout this film, even for me as a gay man, who as a child learned that he needed to catch his sister in a good mood if he wanted to play Barbie with her and ultimately ended up playing with his \\'Star Wars\\' figures a lot instead.The little touches and the interesting special editions of the doll that popped up throughout were cleverly used and some of them easy to remember from trips to the toy shop and the times that I used to sneak in to my sisters room to play with her collection whilst she was out.Add to that a great deal of humour in various styles and it would be hard for even the most masculine, anti-feminist not to find something to laugh at in this film, despite the fact that it took the mick out of men in general.Yes it did make a point of empowering women of all backgrounds, which it was always going to do, but I felt that it did it without making such a harsh attack on men that the average male would feel threatened by it or take the jokes with anything but a pinch of salt and there is always the hope that some people would learn from it.Essentially it was just parodying the way that women have been treated over the years and showing that treatment up for the stupid behaviour that it was and sadly still is by exploring how a matriarchy might effect men and the ways that they might react.The general production of the film came across like a cross between \\'Elf\\' (2003), \\'The Lego Movie\\' (2014), \\'Big\\' (1988) and so many others of that oeuvre.All of it, but specifically Barbieland was brilliantly designed and constructed, colourful and fun, with a great soundtrack and some real laugh out loud moments, a lot of which were quite adult. And while the majority of those jokes might go over the heads of a younger audience, I could see why it was given a 12 rating. The adventure had an emotional depth that might not grip younger kids.With regards to the cast, Margot Robbie was great in her role of stereotypical Barbie. I loved the scene where \"Ugly Betty\" (America Ferrera as Gloria) was applying Margot\\'s make up as it seemed so ironic, but I\\'m afraid that Barb\\'s leading man Ken really stole the limelight, especially with his song \"I\\'m Just Ken\", which has featured very heavily on my iTunes lately.Ryan Gosling was superb as the plasticised blonde and blue eyed man, although at times I wasn\\'t sure whether his toned abs might not actually be a plastic prosthetic, because they weren\\'t totally natural looking.However, I think that I\\'ve found a new appreciation for Ryan after the disaster that was \\'La La Land\\' (2016), because he was just so good in this role. It was another irony that he stood out so much in a film about Barbie, which repeatedly referred to Ken as just an accessory.I also loved Rhea Perlman in her casting. The usually brassy little lady seemed perfect in her role and I thought that she could have performed Helen Mirren\\'s Narrator part as well, because, for the amount Helen actually said, it didn\\'t really need another celebrity and Rhea\\'s character would have leant itself to the voiceover easily.\"Weird\" Barbie, the doll who was played with too much, performed by Kate McKinnon was fantastic and an absolutely great addition to the story.I also liked Michael Cera\\'s character Allan, it wasn\\'t anything very new for him, but delivered a different kind of comic relief with his subtlety and non presence.I did however feel that Will Ferrell had some typical Ferrell moments that were a bit daft and could have been left out, but in the end even he was appropriate in his part of the ditsy Mattel CEO as well.There really was an amalgamation of comedic stylings, which I felt would make it appealing to almost anyone.I\\'m not sure that I caught all of the cameos dotted throughout, but there were some definite surprises and I looked forward to trying to spot them all when I saw it again.I did notice that there was a lot of British actors among the cast though. At least three of them were from the TV series \\'Sex Education\\' (2019-23).Not that I\\'m saying that all those Brits were a bad thing, but it was odd that they were mostly playing Americans. I would assume that a lot of it was filmed in the UK, making it easier to use them.Ultimately I enjoyed the inclusion of all of the British cast, 3 of whom that I\\'ve had the pleasure to work with myself.I specifically liked Connor Swindells as Aaron Dinkins. After his roles in \\'Sex Education\\' and \\'SAS: Rogue Heroes\\' (2022-) I felt that this was yet another example of his diversity.And on the topic of diversity, I really appreciated that people from all walks of life were represented in the film, but not made a fuss of or shoved in my face to prove a point that the film and Barbieland was an educated place. I spotted the Wheelchair Barbie amongst the rest, but they didn\\'t include her in the story just to tick a box and I was glad of that, because I\\'m tired of films trying too hard to be politically correct and compromising the end result to achieve it. That doesn\\'t mean that I wouldn\\'t have been happy to see her play a key role if it had been relevant to the story of course.On my second viewing of this one I felt that there was also a more subtle message about not taking people for granted and another about the fact that you can\\'t stop things from changing. I think it was those ideas that mellowed out the overall strong female empowerment and equal rights message that rightly seemed to be the primary element of the film, because you couldn\\'t help but feel for Ken, whilst also empathising with Barbie.I also remembered that I had thought the end montage to be somewhat lacking in power and I think that was due to the clarity and rush of the images that went by. I would have liked it to have been a bit brighter and certainly visually clearer.As a whole though it was a real pleasure to watch and left me with a smile on my face. I\\'m pretty sure that I will end up with it on DVD, because it was one of those films that will always make me feel a joy to watch, which I believe the world needs more of.838.49/1000.',\n",
              "  'I just finished watching Barbie earlier and while at it, I just can\\'t see any difference and point. I thought, what\\'s the difference of matriarchy and patriarchy? The Barbie\\'s are literally doing (matriarchy) the same thing as what the Ken\\'s do (patriarchy). From the constant repression of their Kens, forever girl\\'s night which means no time for their \"boyfriend\"s, the competition between Ken\\'s about who Barbie likes more then the getting the constitution back to the way it was by using the Ken\\'s emotion then hurting it to get that petty fights between Ken\\'s which made them hate eachother.I understand the difference in their matriarchy and patriarchy. In matriarchy, the government is well done. But the Ken\\'s feelings and competition with eachother is disheartening.While patriarchy is so full of stupid people that ended up destroying and trashing the place. Plus, they only boosted their stoopid ass ego in the situation.Thankfully, it got to the end where they settled about equality in all people and considered first steps and lessons for the Ken\\'s proper education cuz they\\'re certainly a kid at the time. Though, I understand that it was because of the construct they did during the matriarchy of Barbie, I think it\\'s a really good start.',\n",
              "  \"This had a great concept but utterly failed, couldn't understand why Barbie had to just be so mean to Ken. First part was good then just went downhill from there. We kept thinking when is this going to end. We laughed so hard over the movie being so pointless and the sheer stupidity of the storyline. The only best part was when Barbie told the old lady she was beautiful and of Ryan Gosling singing. I loved Barbies but not this way. Margot Robbie is a great actress and I have loved all her movies and she was a great Barbie, and I loved her emotions in the movie but the part was not scripted well for her. They made a fool of her and Ryan Gosling. The writers could have done so much more for these great actors in this movie.\",\n",
              "  \"Barbie movie is a comedy which is based on absurd plot twists and things which happen throughout the film. It offers many laughs and has a lot of hidden jokes which add up to a great movie. I was worried there would be much too many musical scenes, but after watching it I believe they were put there with good reason and in just the right places. The whole scene nearing the end of the film (I won't spoil anyhting, don't worry) was just so well done, I loved that the play on women-male dynamics was very lighthearted, but just serious enough. There is apsolutely no men-bashing.The Ken's were put in the women's places from the Real World and men in the theatres watching saying that the movie is 'too feminist' and is 'men-bashing' are failing to see their hypocrisy.\",\n",

So well done to the Barbie marketing team!I walked in the cinema with no expectations, but I have to say I was overall pleasantly surprised with Barbie. I thought it might be the usual run of the mill silly kids movie, with a completely unserious/unrealistic storyline.However, the Barbie storyline touched on a lot of serious real world issues and situations that many people can relate to. With that said, it did feel like a senseless musical at times, with unesscessary sing/dance scenes.The essence of the film touches on the juxtaposition of what life would be like if women ruled the world (Barbie Land). And the real world we live in, which is male dominated. This was portrayed well, but did get abit too silly sometimes.The level of acting from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, were both bang on. Considering they were playing dolls, they kept a great balance between having to act silly, whilst still keeping a level of seriousness, so the sillyness doesn\\'t go overboard.Overall, \"Barbie\" was actually a decent watch with a good level of comedy and realism, whilst keeping the essence of what Barbie represents.Isit worth a watch?... Whether you are a woman or man, young or old. Barbie has a little bit for everyone to relate to. So for that reason it is worth a watch, but don\\'t go in with high hopes unless you are a die hard Barbie fan!',\n",
              "  'As an avid moviegoer, I recently had the misfortune of watching the latest Barbie movie, and I must say, it was a truly disappointing experience. With high hopes for an entertaining and engaging story, I found myself utterly let down by the lackluster execution and uninspiring plot.First and foremost, the storyline was incredibly predictable and formulaic. It followed the typical \"princess in distress\" narrative, where Barbie, the protagonist, finds herself in a series of contrived situations that require her to rely on her friends to save the day. This tired and overused plotline failed to offer any surprises or originality, leaving me feeling bored and unengaged throughout the entire film.Furthermore, the characters lacked depth and development. Barbie, as the central character, was portrayed as a one-dimensional, perfect individual with no flaws or relatable qualities. This made it difficult to connect with her on any meaningful level, resulting in a lack of emotional investment in her journey. The supporting characters were equally unremarkable, serving as mere plot devices rather than fully fleshed-out individuals.The animation, while visually appealing at times, was inconsistent and failed to impress. Certain scenes appeared rushed and poorly executed, with noticeable flaws in character movements and facial expressions. This lack of attention to detail further detracted from the overall viewing experience.Additionally, the dialogue was clich√©d and lacked any real substance. The script seemed to rely heavily on cheesy one-liners and forced humor, which fell flat and failed to elicit any genuine laughter or amusement. The lack of witty and intelligent dialogue further contributed to the overall mediocrity of the film.In conclusion, the Barbie movie I recently watched was a major disappointment. With a predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and lackluster animation. While it may appeal to younger audiences, for those seeking a more sophisticated and thought-provoking film, this Barbie movie falls far short of expectations. I would not recommend it to anyone seeking quality entertainment.',\n",
              "  'Weeks ago I heard that there was going to be a Barbie movie coming out and my immediate first thought was \"Oh, God.\" I then forgot about it and then saw the trailer for it when we went to see the new Indiana Jones movie. I always enjoy seeing Margot Robbie when I can and Ryan Gosling looked like he was going to bring some humor to the movie, so when my wife asked if I wanted to see it, I said SURE! I\\'m glad I did.The movie was as amusing as I hoped, and it didn\\'t overly rely on tired story lines to make it entertaining. What it also had was a lot of heart. Margot Robbie is an actress that has a ton of sex appeal, but she doesn\\'t use it. She uses her great skill as an actress to convey the story and does it very well.What was really fun about this movie was listening to the kids in the theater responding to it and it was pretty hilarious. My daughter and I were laughing more at that than anything. It was actually a delightful surprise that added to the whole vibe of the movie.Ryan Gosling played a goofball Ken, but he does so in a very controlled and amusing way, and you actually feel for Ken bigtime as the story moves along. He did a great job as well as the rest of the cast that made up all the Barbies and Kens.The only thing I will say takes away from this movie is Will Ferrell. I normally find him amusing in most movies he is in, but in this one, he was completely superfluous. He added not a single laugh nor important aspect to the story line. He just was not needed in this movie.So, if you have a daughter of any age, go see it with her and laugh. It\\'s truly a good time.',\n",
              "  'FIRST OFF LET ME SAY , I couldn\\'t WAIT to see this. Got tickets for myself and friends. We all wore pink. The leads were terrific. The marketing campaign was completely misleading. The first 40 minutes at tops was what we all came to see . Then it became very heavy -handed. It became confusing. MATTEL who was one of the producers of it should feel shame for I think they ruined their good name with how they let themselves be represented. It was PG and right at the beginning when they have the little girls smashing I mean SMASHING their dolls to bits cause now their is Barbie...a couple of little kids in the audience got very upset to see the dolls smashed. THIS IS NOT A KIDS MOVIE. It wasen\"t my kind of movie either. One of my friends said \\'It was about an hour too long.\" Their were these meanings and symbolism tht didnt need to be in this and whatever the writers were trying to get at ...it didn\"t work at least for me.needlessly having Ken sing .......and thats the least of it....referring to the line \"Some of my best friends are jEWISH\"...completly wrong....even though I now know the history of the doll ...just wasen\"t necessary.... I cannot recommend ...I feel i wasted my friends time ....and some of mine...it really hurts your soul when you so look forward to seeing something and it turns out to be ...blech!',\n",
              "  \"Barbie movie was alright. Some scenes were quite cringe and the movie was not that super funny after all. Jokes here and there were sexually but that was it. Nowadays, I believe it is a good thing that the characters in the movie are all people from color. What is still a mystery and confusing is how they left the Barbieworld to the real world and vice versa... Besides the storyline was sometimes random and out of the blue how things turned out. I wouldn't definitely watch this movie again. Though, I would watch it as a drinking game, whenever someone says Barbie you have to take a shot. Cuz damn that word is being said sooo many times!\",\n",
              "  \"Barbie may seem like a kids movie at a glance but its more than that. Even though kids are going to love it (no doubt) this movie is specifically made for adults who used to play with the original Barbies. The Barbies that were shown in the movie being exact same as our own childhood dolls takes you back in the past.Margot Robbie's every single action, either crying and laying down on floor or smiling while kissing, is exactly same as a Barbie doll.America Farrera's monologue deserves multiple nominations. She stole the show. Simu Liu was fantastic in it and actually made me sad for Ryan Gosling's Ken.Ken Song is another masterpiece of this movie but it's not as iconic as Will Ferrel calling himself the 'mother' but the best part about the movie was including and remembering Ruth, the founder of Barbie, and her daughter Barbara.The movie broke the wall in unexpected ways, it's classic comedy direct to audience was one of the many great aspects that I loved.Even though I expected a better ending for Ken and other Barbies the movie ended on a happy note which delighted me.\",\n",
              "  \"This was a very fun, very engaging premise. I don't know if I'd call it groundbreaking, since it's a little derivative of Toy Story and Extra Guy, but this definitely works. The scenery and cast are great, and the movie bristles with energy.I just wish they kept this a little more light-hearted and a little less preachy. There are countless movies that lament victimhood and discrimination, and countless movies that showcase estranged parents and children magically reuniting through remarkable events. But how many great comedies are there these days? How about, for once, just keeping things light and entertaining? (The patriarchy? Seriously?)Regardless, I think most of the audience loved it, and I think most of the women wanted to stand up and cheer during the Mom's big speech. It's a visual feast with just enough laughs and a lot of star power, and you will probably be glad you went.\",\n",
              "  'Oh my goodness, where do I even begin with \"Barbie\" (2023)? This film is an absolute delight and a true masterpiece that will leave you in awe. Directed by the incredibly talented Greta Gerwig and starring the stunning Margot Robbie as the iconic doll herself, \"Barbie\" is a cinematic experience like no other.From start to finish, \"Barbie\" captivates audiences with its seamless blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. Gerwig\\'s direction is nothing short of brilliant as she brings the world of Barbie to life with a perfect balance of humor and depth. The humor, in particular, is off the charts hilarious, with giant laugh-out-loud moments that had me clutching my sides. It\\'s remarkable how the humor appeals to viewers of all ages, making it one of the funniest movies of the year.But what truly sets \"Barbie\" apart is its profound and thought-provoking narrative. The film revolves around Barbie\\'s existential crisis and her quest to find meaning in her existence. This exploration of Barbie\\'s identity as a feminist symbol is incredibly compelling and challenges societal norms and expectations surrounding femininity and girlhood. Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals? This deep, existential question lingers long after the credits roll, prompting introspection and discussion.Margot Robbie\\'s performance as Barbie is nothing short of extraordinary. She brings a charisma and depth to the character that is truly captivating. Watching her journey of self-discovery unfold on screen is an absolute joy. And let\\'s not forget Ryan Gosling\\'s portrayal of Ken, which complements Robbie\\'s Barbie perfectly. Their on-screen chemistry is off the charts and adds another layer of excitement to the film.I should mention that \"Barbie\" has received widespread acclaim from both critics and audiences, and it\\'s easy to see why. It strikes a perfect balance between appealing to longtime fans and captivating new audiences. The movie\\'s mass appeal transcends age, gender, and previous Barbie doll opinions, making it a delightful and engaging experience for viewers of all backgrounds.Despite its PG-13 rating, \"Barbie\" remains family-friendly and suitable for teenagers and older kids. The clever marketing of the film ensures that it appeals to a wide range of audiences, making it a perfect choice for family movie nights.In conclusion, \"Barbie\" is an absolute triumph in every aspect of filmmaking. With its stellar cast, innovative approach, brilliant humor, and profound exploration of societal themes, it more than deserves a perfect 10/10 rating. This cinematic gem is a must-watch for anyone seeking an enchanting and thought-provoking experience that transcends the boundaries of age and nostalgia. Brace yourself to be dazzled and captivated by the delightful world of \"Barbie.\" Trust me, you won\\'t be disappointed!',\n",
              "  \"It's hard to say this movie isn't great even if you don't agree with the third act feminism part. I mean, Margot Robbie nailed it! And Ryan Gosling... come on, i was expecting so much from him, and he was even better than i tought, so freaking funny and always on point! The set production and Costume design are, of course, oscar nominees already.Overall i liked the message, the social critic, the perfomances, the production, the jokes were very funny, the references... what's there not to like? Such an enjoyable movie. Perhaps the part played by America Ferrera required a most skilled actress to carry the emotive part of the movie and the monologue in a more convincing way, but that doesn't ruin the movie at all. I think it's a must watch for cinema lovers and for people who just wanna have a good time as well.\",\n",
              "  'This movie LOOKED amazing. The costumes, sets, editing, and choreography were all high-budget and high-quality. That\\'s probably why the poor writing stuck out like a sore thumb.The characters are one-dimensional, the plot was not developed, the themes are poorly executed, and the ending had almost no connection to the rest of the movie. Other people have mentioned the movie\\'s preachiness; instead of developing the message over the course of the movie, the mother character gives multiple speeches to let the audience know exactly what we\\'re supposed to think. What happened to \"show, don\\'t tell\"?Robbie and Gosling did what they could with the script that they had, making the movie enjoyable enough. The rest of the ensemble had no standouts, and the other Barbies were frustratingly identical in their one-dimensional performances.Speaking of Gosling, did anyone else feel like Ken had more character depth than Barbie? In the BARBIE movie? Don\\'t get me wrong, I loved his performance, but it definitely felt like he upstaged Robbie\\'s Barbie for a large part of the movie.Overall, it was enjoyable, but I wouldn\\'t waste money on a theater ticket. Watch it when it comes out on streaming and form your own opinion.',\n",
              "  'The duality of being perfect and yet still not being enough is portrayed so well here. This movie is about being able to relate to the constant evolution of the human condition, specifically in a way that centers growing up from being a naive child to being aware of yourself and the judgement of others. This movie does center women, but any individual claiming this movie is a misandrist anthem has no idea of even a notion to what the point of this movie was.Hilarious, intelligent, beautiful, poignant, tasteful. This movie makes me warm to the knowledge of being a woman. I will be watching more Greta movies from now on if not all of them. I cried.',\n",

Without the fear of change and the assurance of perfection, Barbie gets through the day partying until she starts thinking about death.

Ken follows her to the Real World where both come across patriarchy, which overwhelms them. When Barbie returns back to her world, she realizes what she is about to lose and how Barbie along with the other Barbies, couple of humans and an Allan, work together to save their world forms the story.Initially, it takes a bit of time to get used to the narrative as well as the humor. Good thing is it doesn't take much time to get me invested in the world of Barbie and Ken. The perfect casting ensured the smooth flow of the story and the likes of Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell took care of elevating a simple scene with their impeccable comic timing. It is the final act, where Greta Gerwig proved why she is among the best to handle mother-daughter relationship or to even narrate women.There are several scenes that earns instant laughter and those scenes are cleverly handled. I did expect atleast a couple of more dance numbers. Ryan Gosling easily became pick of the lot and Margot Robbie owned her character as Barbie. The monologue scene with the mother worked for me and ofcourse the Ken's breakdown towards the end.

              "  'I saw this film with an open mind. I was ready for it to be enjoyable in some sort of way, either visually, through the actors, perhaps a fun story, or just turning off the brain and seeing what they came up with. Unfortunately, it struck out on all accounts. The much hyped visual experience and world building got old fast. The actors were so clich√©d and pigeonholed that they were hard to watch (as you may have heard, Ryan Gosling is the star and most interesting character despite the movie name). The movie was not fun after the first 15 minutes. In fact, it was intentionally written to be painful and to express the writer/director\\'s personal concerns. We were supposed to be frustrated but were not rewarded with any payoff at the end.Most concerning is that Barbie was clearly modeled after the first Matrix movie but in all the worst ways. Barbie\\'s world is a binary place composed of Barbieland, where the embodiments of the toys live and what they call \"The Real World\". The Real World is name of the place they travel to in Matrix as well but, in Barbie, it\\'s not a dark hellish landscape run by machines. Instead, it resembles our actual real world in appearance but it seems to be run by the evil toy company Mattel. Also, the men are all shown to be domineering, rude, and chauvinistic. It\\'s clearly supposed to represent our real world but goes so far into fantasy that it\\'s as unrealistic as the one in The Matrix. A man walking by Barbie sexually harasses her and slaps her on the backside. She then gets arrested for defending herself (what??). While shes being arrested, the male officers comment on her body and sexually harass her more. The toy company executives all wear suits like the Agents in The Matrix and work in unrealistic barren, industrial looking cubicles. They also drive black SUVs around with no regard for law and order as though they are in charge of the world. We get many heavy handed speeches about how badly women are treated in The Real World and I lost count of the number of times the word \"patriarchy\" was used. I know the director wanted to express her thoughts about western society but it was such a dystopian, bleak world that it was impossible to compare it to our world. In The Matrix, there was depth and nuance to both worlds but in Barbie there was mostly sadness in both. The movie shows a fake world dominated by women in the beginning, then a fake world dominated by men as it progresses, and completes by showing us that the two are completely incompatible. The bright, colorful, happy movie we were shown in the promotional material is actually dark, depressing, and irredeemable. If it was meant to reflect our real world, well, it\\'s so far out there that it doesn\\'t even come close. If its mean to show a fantasy world, the fantasy is that there is incompatibility and depression between the sexes with no solution available. It was difficult to complete watching Barbie because it tried to say so much that, in the end, it said nothing at all. It was a fantasy film with only an unhappy, sad fantasy to show once all the pastel colors and fashionable outfits had faded.',\n",

I have no words to express how i feel after watching Barbie. It had to much emotion built into it. Margot Robbie had such a speechless performance. Greta Grewig is the writer and director that can make a movie that has so much emotional value and meaning. It gives you a look into being a woman and the struggles but also about finding who you are as a person. I enjoyed this movie like no other it was hilarious and an emotional rollercoaster.

              "  'Synopsis: Barbie (Played by Margot Robbie) suddenly starts to notice that she is slowly turning away from being the stereotypical Barbie doll with a few changes happening to her. This forces Barbie to discover the real world as well as herself and her purpose as a doll.This film is directed by Greta Gerwig and written by both Greta Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach. In case you did not know, Greta Gerwig is the writer and director of films like Lady Bird (2017) and Little Woman (2018). Both these films are astonishing in terms of the screenplay and dialogues. In addition, Noah Baumbach wrote, directed, and produced Marriage Story (2019) as well as Frances Ha (2012) that had Greta Gerwig as a lead actress role and a writer in the film. Both those films also stood out for mostly the screenplay that is very deep and realistic in terms of the story and dialogues. Therefore, the expectations of Barbie are very high especially that we are talking about having those big names as the filmmakers behind this film. However, the results are unfortunately not near their previous films, especially in-terms of the screenplay.Barbie is a film that is in my opinion targeted mostly for adults. It is like the director described, \"a party for everyone, and everyone is invited\". But, young kids (especially today\\'s new young generation) will feel like it\\'s not the type of party for them. As well as the jokes that feel like mostly adults will get them, especially that some of them include some inappropriate language or idea.The biggest flaws of the film are its most important parts, and the main story mainly evolves around them. Therefore, because they weren\\'t done well, the film lost its balance at most times. Barbie touched on the topic of how a relationship between a mother and a daughter can be and the stages it goes through. This is being portrayed in the weakest way ever and that\\'s due to many reasons mainly for not giving it enough time and discussing it very briefly. Therefore, no emotions or connections are created between both the mother\\'s character and the daughter\\'s character with audience members. As well as, using a young actress to portray the role of the daughter that can be played by someone else with better acting skills. Without spoiling, but, a shorter sequence near the end of the film between 2 irrelevant characters, was able to touch audience members\\' hearts in terms of that topic, better than the characters of the mother and daughter with their sequences that we spent nearly most of the film with trying to connect with their relationship. A huge aspect that had helped in making this sequence a successful one is Billie Eilish\\'s song \"What was I made for\" that was playing in the background during it. I an interview wit Billie, she goes by explaining how this song tells what she went through and felt in an. This can be heard in the song\\'s lyrics and Billie\\'s voice that makes this scene and song very real and original and goes so well with that scene in particular.Another huge flaw is the portrait of the Mattel corporation with its executives, mainly played by Will Farrell as the CEO of Mattel. Very weak, and cringe at times that just made me rather want to go back to the BarbieLnad sequences or Barbie and Ke sequences.Margot Robbie is just phenomenal as Barbie exactly like what everyone expected her to be. She proves herself as an actress that can be added to the list of one of the most significant actresses in the modern time. She is able to play most roles very well and that can be seen from her previous roles like Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad (2016), Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), or previously in Babylon (2022) as Nillie Lorey. On the other hand, Ryan gosling as Ken is shining in this film. I think most of the scenes that I laughed out loud in, where mostly because of jokes performed by Gosling with the help of his acting skills using facial expressions and body language that suits Ken\\'s character and behaviour perfectly. Simu Lui proves himself in this film that he is better in comedy films rather than serious action drama films. I enjoyed his comedic Ken role here more tHan i enjoyed seeing him being a superhero and trying to play a character like Shang-Chu in marvel\\'s Shang-Chi (2021).Greta really uses all the memes and trends that people have created in regards to the Barbie movie on the different social media platforms, and uses them as the main core behind the comedy aspect of the film. These little details are what make Greta\\'s films all different from each other. Also, this is what makes Barbie a film made for the fans specifically. For instance, everyone have seen the meme that is a picture of the gang from Goodfellas wearing suits and looking very fresh, with a caption on it that says: \"4 tickets for the Barbie movie please\". This can clearly be seen in the film as many jokes had a similar idea that evolves around those jokes that you would end to your buddy on Tik Tok or Insta. One of my favourite lines said by Ryan Gosling\\'s Ken is: \"Every night is boys\\' night\".Finally, props to all production design, custom design and editing team that was able to portray BarbieLand and all the different Barbie and Ken versions exactly how they were suppose to look with their pink and colourful world and customs which is a thing that I personally was worried about. The results are more than \"KENough\"My rating is 8/10Watched on July 20th, 2023\\nFormat: Ultra AVX.',\n",

I can not express how much this movie has impacted my life. After seeing it not once, not twice, but three times it gets better and better every time. This movie is so hilarious while also being profound and thought-provoking. I left the theater crying all 3 times, each time shedding more tears than the last. Watching it with my mother was truly a special experience as I got to see how the themes of the movies impacted her as well. I think about this quote at least once a day,\" Mothers stand still so their daughters can look back and see how far they\\'ve come.\" I would recommend the Barbie Movie to anyone and everyone!',\n",
              "  'In my view there\\'s two ways to watch / interpret Barbie. First, watch it with a critical eye about how Mattel have realised that they have to move with the times and to sell more dolls they need to \\'normalise\\' Barbie. Second, just have fun. Both work. It is genius quite frankly. Mattel have taken criticism on the chin but ultimately know that they\\'ll be quids in with a new \\'flat footed\\' Barbie.You should watch it and work out where you stand. To refuse to watch it because it\\'s \"about a doll\" is missing the point in my view. It\\'s a great movie to just watch and have fun with but equally you could watch it with a critical eye and work out where you stand.',\n",

Those who were offended that they stereotyped men and made so many of them \"weak\" or \"stupid\" in this movie are seriously missing the point. They stereotyped it all (women included) in a way that was very intentional and drove home some incredibly difficult aspects of the modern human condition. They took impossibly stressful expectations that society pushes on both sexes and made them light hearted and surprisingly emotional. As a woman, even though the situations with men in the movie were exaggerated and oversimplified, they were all incredibly reflective of so many of the experiences that I and countless other women have lived through. It was nice to be seen (and to be able to laugh and cry at how on point they were)... I very rarely feel that from a movie, much less from a movie about dolls that I hardly ever chose to play with as a kid. I think the only thing I was hoping for more of was a greater acknowledgment of some less binary identities. In my opinion there were so many opportunities to more than subtlety hint at diversity there. Either way I\\'m pleasantly surprised at the entertaining way they tackled serious issues, how they incorporated pop culture, and how they both gave homage to the history and aesthetic of Barbie without hiding from some of the dark aspects of Mattel\\'s past.',\n",

I am a guy so here it is my review, after watching barbie movie.Talking about the positive... Barbie movie gives a strong massage of gender equality and women empowerment. Everything is good in the movie except few things, which we will talk about in the negative. And Yaa the song in the end \"What was i made for\" By Billie Eilish was so good so extra thumbs up for that too.Talking about the negative... First few minutes I feel like what the hell is happening on the screen. But once I get into the movie it was a good watch. And in the second half there one was a fight scene which looked like an overdramatic thing to me.So, if you are a guy and looking forward to watching it, my opinion is that You should give it a try and off course others should also give it a try because it a good movie to watch with great social massage.I am sure you will not regret my recommendation.',\n",
              "  \"The movie is entertaining, most often when it just embraces the absurdity of the doll world. However, the feminist messaging is so heavy handed it feels like parody most of the time. Ken discovering the patriarchy was amusing but the joke goes too far, and again the only way I can describe it is that the message feels like a parody of itself, but you can tell that it's meant to be taken seriously.I still think the movie is fun and genuinely amusing in places. But the most I enjoyed it was when we were with the Kens which I feel is a misfire in Barbie's movie.I almost wish they had just made a comedic film, set mostly in Barbieland, and left the human characters out.I admire what they tried to do, but the tones of the silly Barbie movie and the critique of society segments didn't mesh well.\",\n",

Then I read a review by Michael Knowles, and I realized I missed something very crucial at the start. My teenaged daughter and I went back, and we watch it from the beginning. This is a very clever movie. The layers of cleverness become very apparent when you look beyond the surface. It is a story of current society- and the ills that plague us.I think, at first, everyone is concerned about the audience for the movie- it is definitely not meant for younger kids. But it is rated PG-13- I'd say the innuendo is a bit much for 13, but it may just go right over their heads. Ultimately, I think this movie has been very misjudged by a lot of critics. It is way deeper than Barbie maybe should be, but it is great for adults who don't like what they see in our current state of existence.\",\n",
              "  'I initially thought this movie was this movie was about Barbie finding out that she was a toy, but she actually already knows that! Anyway, this movie was about Barbie getting real emotions and going to the real world to find the girl (revealed to be a grown woman) who\\'s playing with her Barbie toy wrong. There\\'s a halfway plot switch, as the second half is about Ken (well, the Kens) taking over Barbieland and changing it to Kenland. I admit that the second half isn\\'t as good as the first. The movie probably could have been trimmed by twenty minutes and it would have been better. Will Ferrell is in this, but the problem is that he isn\\'t used more.Wait, he was in \"Stranger Than Fiction\", a movie about a guy who found out his life was being controlled by a writer. He was in \"The Lego Movie\" as the father of a son playing Legos who found out they were alive. Now he\\'s in this movie about Barbie finding out her purpose. Is this all the same character?! Anyway, the Kens aren\\'t really villains and it\\'s nice to see such a beautiful looking movie with great costumes, some great jokes and a fairly unique setup.

The feminist rant stuff is unapologetically there, not as frequent as some people are saying, it came across to me like content from an \\'80s female stand up comedienne, so nothing original, and very dated. The script is messy and doesn\\'t make a lot of sense even regarding it\\'s own internal logic.The \"empowerment\" stuff in it is very generic, a lot of the sentiment is kid\\'s film-level \"just be yourself and like yourself\" thinking that applies to any person, but it\\'s only the girls in the film that make these profound \"revelations\" as they are the creative gender and the guys (in Barbie land and the \"real\" world) are all cardboard cut-out airheads.The film is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is, it\\'s pretty shallow and light-weight and isn\\'t going to leave lasting impact in pop culture, good or bad, pretty forgettable really. Kids of an impressionable age will most likely just be bored by it, and most older people will see it for the weak sauce it is.',\n",

There was a perfect balance between the replication of our own childhood experiences with the dolls, and the introduction of the hopeful changes for the current state of the world. The way the movie made our little imaginations come to life on the big screen was magical. It was great to see a movie about barbie, the stereotypical perfect doll , being so inclusive and aware of issues we still have today. It was emotional, funny, and a breath of fresh air. Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and the rest of the cast... just bravo. It was truly so wonderful & I can't wait to watch it again.\",\n",
              "  'Barbie is one of the most iconic toys of all time! It genuinely baffled me that it took this long for there to be a Barbie film. Barbie isn\\'t my thing, so I wasn\\'t interested in watching this. It wasn\\'t until the first trailer came out and the global internet cultural phenomenon \"Barbenheimer\", the release of Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day, that my interest was piqued. So is life plastic, it\\'s fantastic? Or is it just Ken?Firstly, casting Margot Robbie as Stereotypical Barbie was perfect! She is incredibly charming and earnest in the role. She conveys a naive yet caring nature to her character while being very funny at times. Ryan Gosling as Beach Ken is also perfect casting! He is the greatest highlight with his hilarious physical performance. Every time he is on screen, he brings the laughs. Ryan also conveys a vulnerability to Ken which is surprising. Margot and Ryan have a fun chemistry together! This film has a huge cast with many playing other variations of Barbie and Ken. They are all good in their limited screen time but the stand out is Michael Cera who plays Ken\\'s best buddy Allan. I just love how different he is from the others and how he manages to be so lovable in his limited screen time.From the first 30 minutes, you will notice the amazing costumes and set designs. Barbieland itself looks like a Barbie toy set brought to life. The massive amount of pink covering the world, the plastic look of all the accessories, houses and cars. Every Barbie and Kens clearly had a lot of thought put into their costumes because no Barbie and Ken look the same. Every costume manages to reflect the type of Barbie and Ken they are. The music score is great and the use of vocal songs was utilized effectively. Special mention to \"I\\'m Just Ken\" sung by Ryan Gosling! Some great dance scenes are entertaining to watch with their fun choreography. It is a comedy at heart and there are quite some funny jokes and moments with a surprising amount of great adult jokes. I also love how they poke fun at Mattel and even Barbie as a brand which is a bold move. Despite that, some strong emotional moments with one near the end can definitely tug at the heartstrings.However, the movie does suffer from some poor execution of certain elements. There is the Barbieland stuff which is enjoyable but the real-world stuff is just not that fun. It is stated early on that Barbie\\'s thoughts are being influenced by someone playing with Barbies in the real world. How does the connection work? How much of Barbie\\'s thought is her own? None of these things are explored, leaving many questions. On that note, certain characters will change very quickly without much build-up to these changes. Due to this, we don\\'t get a true understanding of Barbie as a character, she changes because the film needs some kind of character development. There is also a mother and daughter character in the real world who Barbie meets. One of them is depressed and there is a rift between them but the film doesn\\'t bother to explore the reason for any of that. We also meet Will Ferrell who plays the CEO of Mattel and he is just inconsequential to the story but takes a lot of screen time. He is also over-the-top and silly.I was hoping for a contrast between the cartoony Barbieland and the real world. However, characters in the real world act just as cartoony and ridiculous as those in Barbie Land. It makes the real-world scenes less impactful when it should have been a big moment in the film. The film is also incredibly preachy about its feminist message that it can be exhausting. Also, the 3rd act has a silly resolution that feels contradictory to the feminist nature of this film. Additionally, every male character in this film are idiotic baby and if that gets under your skin, then this movie is not for you.Overall, Barbie is a good fun time. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. This film is not going to appeal to everyone with its themes and message. Nevertheless, the movie is just plain entertaining and honestly, it is \"Kenough\" for me!',\n",

This movie should be a reflection of men and women it\\'s not a kid\\'s movie they will not understand it but more for those who grew up watching it and playing with dolls as she was the first girl toy that went outside the mother role she is a role model to many young girls who are now women and a lesson to men who will never understand you can call me a feminist by truly women has it hard \"men hate women, women hate women\"',\n",

Loved the whole production, the set designs and costumes. But the movie dragged in parts, and it just got worst towards the end. I wish they had a solid and fun ending, but they tried to go a different way, which didnt sit well with me. Don't want to really comment about the feminism empowerment, I am all for it but it was too in your face, and this being supposed to be a light and fun movie, ruined the entertainment for me. Being a women, there are of course many issues faced in reality. But this one didn't really nail it.Among the performances Ryan Gosling was really good as Ken. Margot is very likeable in the movie and looks gorgeous. Will Ferrell was fun to watch and I'm glad he was in the movie.Overall a confusing plot, I wouldn't watch it again. The movie was a little less than 2 hrs Why did I felt it longer?\",\n",
              "  \"At the beginning, it cleverly reflects social issues through gender reversal, but not merely as a reversal. Both gender groups retain their essence, and the ending isn't about one group's victory over the other, but about working together. It encompasses not only gender equality but also recognition and acceptance of others and oneself. It's not about feminism, patriarchy, or gender confrontation. It's not about stereotypes or perfectionism. It's about gender equality, embracing individuality, and mutual understanding. This movie isn't exclusively for women; it showcases the fierce presentation of chuunibyou (middle school syndrome) in both genders. Outstanding performances and dance sequences keep the entire film engaging without clich√©s.\",\n",
              "  'I was expecting a little more given the hype and was a little disappointed by a few aspects of the film. Firstly I\\'ll say that Margot as Barbie and Ryan as Ken were great individually. A large part of why this movie was good enough is because of what they brought to the characters and the story on screen. I found watching Ken discovering \"patriarchy\" to be hilarious. However, one of the first critiques I have is that it felt like the movie didn\\'t spend enough time in Barbieland. The serious shift felt a little too sudden when it could have benefitted from fleshing out the \"perfect\" life and the character dynamics of the barbies and Kens with more substance. Because I felt that was missing, the emotions Barbie was experiencing in the real world fell flat to me, which brings me to my second point.The movie\\'s use of heavily weighted political words by the barbies and kens water down the overall message this film is trying to convey. I think being a woman in the real world is a lot more complicated than going on a beach and getting harassed. Or seeing a bunch of men working and socialising in corporate. I understand the way the movie addresses this is meant to be with a comical and somewhat obvious tone, and it was. However, it could have benefitted from also adding a bit more of a layered experience to these issues which would consequently add more dimensions to when these politically weighted words were used. It just felt, in my personal opinion, to be thrown around for the convenience of making a point amongst all the silliness but with no real material message.It was an enjoyable film in its own merits. However, I was disappointed in the development of the storyline and the characters so I give Barbie a 7/10. I think Greta is talented and I preferred her previous work like Lady Bird. This was a little too mainstream without much substance, thus, Barbie\\'s empowering message fell flat to me.',\n",
              "  \"Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, is a satirical and surreal comedy masterpiece that subverts and celebrates the iconic doll and her world. It's a small art house film on a big blockbuster scale. It's something we need more. It deserves acclaim for that risk that Mattel, WB, Gerwig and all its Cast and Crew took. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, a plastic perfectionist who struggles to fit in with the rigid expectations of her society. When she is expelled from Barbieland for not being flawless enough, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, where she meets a diverse and colorful cast of characters who challenge and inspire her. Along the way, she learns to embrace her flaws, find her voice, and unleash her inner sparkle.Gerwig's direction is brilliant, balancing humor and heart with a sharp eye for detail and a playful sense of style. The film is full of witty references, clever jokes, and hilarious situations that poke fun at the absurdity and contradictions of Barbie's culture, while also honoring its legacy and appeal. The cinematography, production design, and costumes are stunning, creating a vibrant and immersive visual experience that contrasts the artificiality of Barbieland with the realism of the human world.Robbie's and Gosling's performance is outstanding, capturing both the innocence and the sass of Barbie, as well as her growth and transformation. Gosling shines so bright in this. His song is chef's kiss! They are supported by a stellar ensemble. Barbie is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and think. It is a smart and subversive commentary on gender, beauty, identity, and consumerism, as well as a tribute to the power of imagination, creativity, and individuality. It is a film that proves that anyone can be anything they want to be, as long as they are true to themselves. It is a film that deserves a 10/10 rating. The Godfather of whatever this movie's genre is....\",\n",

I felt nothing for anything, and the preachy ending was overblown. And I thought Mattel had pasted together old 70s \"After School Special\" or \"Johnathan Livingston Seagull\" -ish clips to give some feeling. I got tired of hearing the Mattel brand name; it grew tiresome, and the accessories to the pieces of plastic they used as consumerism at its best. The only thing I liked was the end credits going through Mattel\\'s plastic products associated with Barbie - and I loved seeing the dog that pooped.It didn\\'t grab me; I didn\\'t find it funny anywhere. It went from the most annoying opening to as far as one can get annoying in every second of this film. The music was shallow; the production design teetered on Terry Gilliam\\'s work but without the imagination or talent, and old 1920s/1930s film backgrounds and old Three Stooges routines were very tiring.This film was not for me or my demographic; it is for Barbie lovers, and to be honest, when my mom bought me one, I set her blonde hair on fire and ran her over on my Big Wheel, so maybe that had something to do with it.I gave it a view through and can never honestly get that time back.

The film starts strong with an impeccable introduction referencing \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" and then transitions to the gigantic dollhouse that is Barbieland. The production design is simply incredible, the use of CGI is imperceptible, the practical effects are great, the costumes are unique, and the makeup and hair contribute to the excellent art direction. The performances are all good, especially those of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, who as Ken manage to steal the scenes several times. The weakest point lies in the script, which hits and misses at every moment. Its execution is good, the story itself works well, even without explaining some details. Nothing comes close to hindering the experience. Greta aims to deliver strong critiques and attempts to remain neutral, but at a specific moment, she forces it too much, causing a disconnection with the viewer. In the following scene, there\\'s a spectacular sequence involving Ken, creating a sensation that his storyline is better. It\\'s not; it\\'s just more entertaining.

You can see where it\\'s headed a mile away. But the way it carves its own path there using its unique premise, the property, and its stylistic blend of modern humor that reflects the real world is particularly well done.

The Barbies then manipulate the Kens, using feminine wiles and playing dumb, to coerce the Kens into a war with each other to distract them back into submission.Adding to a magnum of plot holes, and an ending that takes WAY too long, is a weird 'Pinocchio' twist when Barbie only becomes satisfied with her existence when she gets a vagina.This film panders to a pseudo-feminist audience.

But that doesn't mean I thought the movie was bad, I thought it was funny and charming all throughout, but I guess my issue is that I'm in the wrong demographic. Near the beginning and near the end, there's a strong theme of motherhood and the troubles of being a woman, and as a man, I can't relate. As a result, I had a hard time relating to a lot of this movies big plot points and emotional moments. And on top of that, halfway though it becomes exceedingly boring. But overall, I'd say it's a solid 7/10.\",\n",
              "  \"Barbie was the perfect combination of light weighted fun in Barbieland with greatly timed one-liners, other clever barbie-themed aspects of barbies reality vs 'the real world' and a deep (not so hidden) meaning behind modern society, the patriarchy and feminism.There could have been so many things done wrong in this movie that Barbie did right! The casting was incredible. Even Ryan Gosling, who I beforehand thought was too old, was great and obviously well chosen for this role. Margot Robbie as the literal star of the show was of course explicitly well cast and played barbie like a second skin.There is diversity, modern issues and a whole lot of fun, the whole theater was constantly giggling and laughing. I think Barbie is a movie that really shows modern issues in a casual way and would be an eye-opener to many people (admittedly, mostly men) on how society views women in day-to-day life.\",\n",
              "  \"I enjoyed the film more for its choreography and the characters' sympathy than for the confusing message. Is it that Ken should understand he was created to be Barbie's friend forever? Is it that a man in love must surrender to a second place? I hope I can read the actual purpose of the story from the writers.Barbieland is shown as a happy monotonous human-like world with empty containers resembling our not so happy monotonous real life where men condescend with a higher ranked male model, something a second rank character wished to be back at his fantasy world. Please, if anyone finds out the actual mess-age let me know.\",\n",
              "  'I think the extensive hype and the long standing popularity of the Barbie brand are responsible for bringing several generations of fans into the theaters resulting in the opening sales. It certainly isn\\'t the movie, itself. The storyline was overly simplistic, poorly written and I didn\\'t find its style of absurd humor to be funny. The movie relied a lot on sight gags that I thought fell flat. The ending seemed to come out of the blue and was a poor attempt at profundity. Margot Robbie IS the consummate Barbie, but she pretty much plays \"actress Barbie\" in everything she does, so it wasn\\'t anything groundbreaking for her. I thought Gloria and Sasha were the best characters and the combination of their performances along with the costumes and sets are the reason I gave the movie any stars at all. The concept of patriarchy certainly isn\\'t anything new and IMO there are much better films on the subject - starting with any of the Jane Austin films and this director\\'s other film - Little Women.',\n",

The scenes when it is trying to prove that also seem overlong. But, those scenes are funny, as is the rest of the film. I also enjoyed the direction it took with this not really being a children's film.Overall, i really enjoyed this movie, it has great humour, and great performances, but some scenes go on for too long.

This movie is a shoo in for an academy award best picture. And is far, far, far more talky and intellectual than any prior best movie winner.Sure. It isn't Simone de Beauvoir. Of course it couldn't possibly be. No one would go see it. But you can feel Greta Gerwig wanting to go there and restraining herself. And yes it slips into dumb middle brow nonsense on more than one occasion, simplifying an absurdly complicated set of issues. But not to the extent that pretty much every other Hollywood movie simplifies. There is meat here. Intelligence. Not to mention tremendous performances. And fantastic set design and a totally gonzo over the top plot. And it is fun. Wild wonderful fun.You know, if you want to influence the world you first have to be popular. Like Blackpink and their powerful girl power message sent out to their tens of millions of tween followers.

Some of the narrator quirks delivered by Helen Mirren are just perfect and I found myself laughing more than anything else.There are so many nuanced things that make the movie so sweet but the best is probably the nod to the original creator of Barbie and the reason the doll was produced to start.',\n",

I love the use of practical effects in creating a living playset, and most of the jokes at Mattel\\'s expense land pretty well.The most common criticism I\\'ve heard is that it\\'s preachy; and maybe it is. All I can say for certain is that it spoke to everyone in my household (we\\'re all feminists here).

Ken doesn't feel loved and respected or important in the Barbie world. He steps into the real world where men are respected and many thing revolves around them and he realizes that he can be more. I hope that this movie could help men feel more empathy towards women and the way this world makes them feel less valuable and important. Women couldn't own property before and in Barbie world Kens didn't have a home to call their own or any important positions.Because women in the real world wear multiple hats, they have to be seen in many ways. They have to do many contradictory things to be liked. Women have to tie themselves in knots to be liked by other people. That's what this show tried to say too.I wish the Barbies realized how they were excluding the Kens and not treating them with respect and made changes to fix that. The world we live in is so male focused that we are so used to it that it seems normal and not unusual. But just like everything being ruled and centered on the women in the Barbie world seems strange, you realize the reverse is strange too.The movie had that message to me but it also was fun and light hearted and went by very quickly. It was enjoyable and entertaining.I guess the very end was not satisfying to me though. It got too weird and pointless at the end.\",\n",

There aren't many movies like it.The acting is phenomenal to play the stereotypical characters from the barbie universe and the jokes are brutally honest and also funny.This movie takes a turn from the regular sci-fi movies that come out on a daily basis and is a recommended watch for family time as well as people looking for something aside from the norm.\",\n",

I had a perpetual grin on my face the entire two hours, only growing wider with every joke. I'm glad I experienced it in a theatre setting, laughing along with others is a great feeling - and there was plenty of laughs to go around. Genuinely one of the funniest films I've seen in a while, the adult-targeted cultural/societal humour really, really worked. Theres not much to say about the set design, costume dept., hair, makeup, and sets other than its nothing short of awe-inspiring. The production design is pretty much flawless. Also, the movie references and homage payed to classics like 2001 and the Matrix was very, very much appreciated. My only complaint would be the third act of the film. I feel like the fast, satirical humour of the first two acts worked perfectly, challenging and poking fun at cultural, societal and political norms, but doing so in a clever way which serves the story and script - gracefully. The third act throws this creative ingenuity out the window by way of heavy handed, in-your-face monologues.\",\n",

We all know this just to well - recent decade has basically led cinema to the murky pastures of cheap entertainment, yet another area big biz benefits from. There\\'s literally no limits to what has been awkwardly transfered onto the tv screen. And the Barbie flick is just that - another step away from what movies used to and ought to be.What we\\'ve got here is just nothing. A big nothing badly wrapped with a celophane of story that makes no sense, carries no worth and is so poorly filmed. Even seeking \"fun\" in this one is like grasping for a breath in an abbatoir. All these comments about feminism or meaningfulness overlook the basic issue - this is just un-watchable by even the lowest standards.I\\'m sort of used to industry mocking me as a viewer every step of the way.

I mean they really thought out every little detail!My favorite part is that: if you love this movie, you get the movie. And if you hate the movie, you also get the movie. It truly is a movie for people who love it and hate it. It\\'s for everyone.I\\'d like to talk about the genius of this plot for a moment. We start off in a matriarchal society. However, it\\'s a society created by little girls, so the Barbies are not violent towards the Kens. They just aren\\'t obsessed with the Kens. The Kens are just in the background, this is representative of how children girls feel. Then, we go into the real world and we are introduced to a patriarchal society. But not just any patriarchal society. It\\'s a society created by adults. So we see toxic masculinity and we see violent tendencies. Then, we go back to Barbieland and Ken brings all of his knowledge of the patriarchy with him. He creates a toxic meninist movement, which emphasizes the point that extremism is not the answer. We cannot overcorrect a mistake or it will cause more mistakes. The Kens start to become violent, even towards each other. This is a good representation of what women deal with in the real world. We can\\'t even rely on each other sometimes. Women can be hateful towards each other as well. Finally, the movie comes to a close with Barbie taking a small step in the right direction. She says it doesn\\'t have to be \"Barbie and Ken\", \"it\\'s Barbie and it\\'s Ken\". Now here\\'s we\\'re people start to get pissed. Barbie just got done saying that the Barbie\\'s and Ken\\'s need to start living as equals, but when when of the Kens asks to be on the Supreme Court the President Barbie says no that\\'s too far, let\\'s start with maybe a cabinet member or something.... Wow how could they... just kidding. You\\'re SUPPOSED TO BE ANGRY about this! This is an accurate representation of the real world! The movie literally ends with the Barbie world being an exact replica of the real world, only with the gender roles reversed.Another thing I\\'d like to point out is that even Ken says at the end that he didn\\'t really like patriarchy anyway. He just wanted to ride horses. Again, this is because he is a doll in a world created by children. I think there\\'s a lot to unpack here but my overall take was that the world is a better place from the POV of a child and adults are the ones who are ruining everything. Even Mattel is kind of shown as a \"bad guy\" in the movie, but even they say, they didn\\'t make Barbie for her to become a sexualized standard. They made Barbie to allow girls to dream of more than just being a mother. With Barbie they can be anything they want to be. It wasn\\'t until adults came along and taught us to sexualize Barbie, that we started to hold her to a different standard.I think most people watch this movie and see the beauty and the genius of it. I think a few hateful people will watch this movie with their tainted glasses and their preconceived biases and they will get very close to understanding it. Every person I\\'ve see criticizing this movie, I\\'m like you\\'re SO CLOSE to the point. You\\'re basically running head first into it. That is the most frustrating and the most gratifying thing about this movie. It\\'s a trap. You can\\'t say hateful things about it, without PROVING THE POINT OF THE MOVIE!',\n",

The movie serves as a poignant reminder of the valuable lessons it imparts to its audience. Through an engaging narrative, the film explores the resilience and strength of its characters, particularly Barbie, as they navigate the complexities of the world around them.The movie's strengths lie in its exceptional cast and impeccable direction. The actors bring their characters to life with remarkable depth, making it easy for the audience to connect with their journeys. The attention to detail in the Barbie world is awe-inspiring, capturing the essence of the beloved toy and its universe. Every frame is meticulously crafted, mirroring the way real-life enthusiasts play with their Barbie dolls.However, the film's climax leaves something to be desired. The resolution feels somewhat abrupt, leaving the audience yearning for a more satisfying conclusion. It's akin to being left in the middle of a captivating story, with questions lingering in the air. While the movie successfully conveys its message, the execution of the final act could have been more polished to provide a more fulfilling viewing experience.One of the movie's standout moments involves Barbie's venture into the real world, showcasing her bravery and determination as she strives to make a difference. Yet, despite the film's best efforts, this pivotal moment lacks the emotional connection needed to truly resonate with the audience. The resolution of their struggles and the restoration of happiness, although achieved, feel somewhat disconnected, leaving viewers wanting more closure.In the grand scheme of things, Barbie (2023) stands as a commendable cinematic creation, not without its flaws but brimming with potential. The film earns praise for its outstanding performances, meticulous direction, and faithful portrayal of the Barbie universe. While it may not reach the heights of a cinematic masterpiece, it undoubtedly serves as a thought-provoking and visually captivating piece of storytelling.In conclusion, I would rate Barbie (2023) a 7 out of 10. It might not achieve perfection, but it offers a unique and engaging perspective, making it a must-watch for enthusiasts and curious minds alike. Give it a chance; you might find yourself pleasantly surprised and, perhaps, even inspired.Thank you for reading my review. Love you .\",\n",

Opening on the conceit that Barbies live a charmed existence in a sequestered pink plastered village of their own w/their Ken counterparts sharing in the glory as they go forward in their day to day duties. Robbie is the nominal center of attention who suddenly gets pangs of an existential dilemma which prompts her & Gosling, who has stowaway'd in her car, as she heads to the real world to get some answers. Reaching there, Robbie finds the axis of her feelings are coming from a Mattel employee, America Ferrara & to a certain extent her daughter, Ariana Greenblatt, but Robbie doesn't count on pesky Gosling to reach his own sense of male patterned nirvana as he gleans the real world moves along a patriarchal arc which he takes back home to remake their world in his own image which starts to affect real world Barbie products (Ken dolls are becoming more prominent) but more importantly Robbie & the rest of her Barbie compatriots standing in their own home turf. A great conceit to be sure which for me left me in a state of nonplussed-itude since I never played w/the dolls growing up & for all the people which were affected by this smart take on a piece of plastic from Oscar nominated co-writer/director Greta Gerwig, I salute you but I wish I loved it more or at all but something like this can only affect someone if they're willing to accept it which sadly but gladly I may be in the minority of.\",\n",

Here in lies \"Lady Bird\" filmmaker Greta Gerwig\\'s creative, modern-day approach to bringing one of America\\'s most recognizable toys to life on screen. When you add that to the decision to cast Margot Robbie in the lead role, \"Barbie\" is off to the right, flawlessly arched start.Barbie\\'s aspirational charm contributes to her brand\\'s strength. Barbie has been criticized for imposing unattainable beauty standards, but she also served as a reminder to girls that everything is possible because different models have depicted her as the president, a rocket scientist, and even transgender. Do you know who else has inflated ideals of beauty? Celebrities in movies. They act as role models, much like Barbie, which is why Gerwig\\'s interpretation of the wildly successful toy brand is so creative.While making Ryan Gosling\\'s dumb Ken the brunt of most of its gender-equity humor, this film hits all the appropriate criteria. The result is a very funny children\\'s film with the phrases of a first-year liberal arts student, which tosses around terms like \"patriarchy\" and \"appropriation\" - pretty much everything but \"problematic,\" which the film means without actually referring to Barbie\\'s legacy.The script by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach feels most audacious on this front. The hit movie \"Barbie\" openly accuses the best-selling doll of undermining the women\\'s movement in addition to making light of Mattel.With a subject like this, the power of nostalgia shouldn\\'t be understated, since much of Gerwig\\'s approach affects mature women and homosexual audiences who have owned the dolls - and for whom she has concealed references and deep-cut facts throughout. Even though Gerwig occasionally uses the film as the vehicle for what seems like a gender studies lecture for undergraduates, it is evident that the movie was created by professionals who understand how children\\'s imaginations develop while playing with Barbies.',\n",

It fails to cater to any age group - not for kids, not for teenagers, and certainly not for adults. It left me with the same feeling of disillusionment as \"Matrix 4\" and the final part of \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\" It\\'s baffling to see what\\'s happening in the American film industry lately. Writers, producers, and directors seem to have lost touch with what makes a great movie, consistently churning out films that do nothing but disappoint.In the case of \"Barbie,\" it\\'s a classic example of how a beloved character can be mishandled on the big screen.

The WOMEN EMPOWERMENT in this film is like no other as it really does capture what Barbie is all about.The dolls children play with have a much deeper value than I ever thought possible as one can truly be anything with Barbie. There are so many little details in the film that made this come alive.Barbie is an incredible film, touching and empowering, loving and brave.

              "  'I think perhaps my feelings about this movie were negatively affected by all of the marketing and reviewer hype; I expected a great movie, and what I watched was \"okay.\"Firstly, the cinematography has a very 90s quirkiness to it. I immediately thought \"Tank Girl,\" and not in a good way. It\\'s an anachronistic aesthetic, honestly.Many of the scenes are a tad long, overstaying their welcome. The script and movie overall could\\'ve used another round of revision and editing, to take out 30 minutes of unnecessary dialogue.If you told me that Greta Gerwig was playing with Barbies one day on the floor, and everything she made the dolls say while playing she then wrote down and it verbatim became the script, I\\'d believe you.The overall message of the movie is delivered by the characters in ham-fisted monologues. Now, if the subject was something we\\'ve probably never heard of, like the sci-fi concepts in Inception and the Matrix, a stilted monologue feels awkward, but necessary.But the plight of women in a male hegemony is such a ubiquitous subject, so well known, that to deliver speeches with such zero dramatic subtlety makes me think the movie is better suited for preteens who are only just learning these things.It\\'s trite, in short.There are many ridiculous, light scenes mixed with heavy, emotional poignant scenes. And that\\'s fine, that works-- except the transition between those scenes is ungraceful, to the detriment of both types.The Ken dance scene is fabulous.Several of the jokes and physical comedy were HILARIOUS, but several of them fell pretty flat.I really liked Lady Bird. And I know that this movie is very different in tone; I expected that. I like weird stuff, that\\'s not the issue.This movie\\'s execution feels kind of sophomoric to me, like they thought it was enough that it was a kooky idea, and thus didn\\'t need to apply any editorial rigor that you\\'d expect in a contemporary movie.',\n",

I think Greta did an amazing job, both Margot and Ryan played their part so well, and speech from America made me cry with few tears, all that was said is what all women feel. Billie's song was cherry on top. An 8 on surface since I thought to myself - why would they include such badly executed cgi, and a 10, because um, it's barbie, it's barbie land... it isn't real life, and men should be glad that it's not.\",\n",

Loved this side of it, and I remember seeing lots of YouTube videos that went over all the details and how they are connected to real life or to other media. It also has a really good pacing, and overall feels more like an adult fairytale. Which may not be something for everyone, obviously.I remember when it just came out a lot of people were praising the show for how females are portrayed, and bashed it for how males are portrayed. And there were some who did the reverse. I would say that both sides are correct. Not to go too much into details, patriarchy is depicted as the evil of the world, and matriarchy is the only way to save it. This is not only not true, but it is also shallow, and ignoring real examples of matriarchic rule.At the same time, the movie does touch upon real issues that men face in real life, like the need to fight for even a slither of attention. This is good, but it gets kind of brushed off at the end, almost as if it did not matter, that that\\'s what brought about Kendome. \"Kenough\" shirt is a good message, but it gets overpowered by the main message, that it is enough for women to just be ordinary. Which is also a good message, but...\\nThe movie just forgot that in reality you need equality. You need both sides to be present and finding common ground. It is ok to be ordinary for both sides, and both sides can do amazing things. To be honest, for more than first half of the movie, I thought that would be the final message, but in the end it was muddied by \"women are better\", which felt disingenuous and worsened overall experience. The final scene, though did even more damage, but maybe I just did not get it, since I am a guy.Either way, it was more or less an enjoyable experience. Overhyped? Probably yes. Worth a watch? Also, probably yes, if you temper your expectations.',\n",

It questions gender roles in a fluid way, and brings existential questions to the fore.By the way, I don't understand the opinions of those who didn't like the film because it promoted feminism. Whereas Barbie is literally an invention designed to make women feel as important as men in society, to break down stereotypes and glorify gender equality.Ok whatever, go and see it, it's worth it.\",\n",

On the other hand, miserable but thriving Kens' lives with various music was very comical and fun. Such a landscape and world-setting is something only few of us have seen in real world where women have increasingly thrived for social power.Meanwhile, the storyline is pretty straightforward. It is a typical fantasy movie that a character goes to real world, cause a problem intertwined with the imaginary and real world and solve them together with real humans.

Now the first 10-15 minutes were rough to get through for myself with the introduction to Barbie world, which is understandable considering what it is. But then even leading into the \"Real-World\" part of the film some of it still had the cheesy bits that I didn\\'t like.

But sadly, she and I were very disappointed.Like to my sister, Barbie means something to girls everywhere, teaching the important and necessary values aimed at women, and giving them a role model to look up to. But after seeing this movie I can\\'t tell you what Barbie stands for.In \"Barbie\" Margot Robbie\\'s character is called a \"fascist\" and a terribly unrealistic image of a perfect woman. Ken is emasculated, fed sexist stereotypes and turned into a joke. The rest of the other Barbies are manipulative and standard feminist archetypes.I\\'m not political, but there\\'s an obvious message the writers are pushing here. And it\\'s not subtle at all.

              "  '\"Barbie\" (2023), directed by Greta Gerwig, stands as a film that ignites conversation, not just about its spectacle but also its heavy-handed approach to delivering its message. At the heart of my experience was a sense of disillusionment, not with the film\\'s ability to dazzle visually-because, in this aspect, it truly excels-but with its insistence on a sermonizing tone that detracts from the cinematic storytelling.The Preachiness Problem: Gerwig\\'s Barbie world is more than just a canvas of pink; it\\'s a platform for preaching. The film, in its zeal to address gender norms and societal expectations, often crosses the line from showing to telling, leaving little room for viewers to engage with the narrative on their own terms. This didactic approach undermines the essence of \"show, don\\'t tell,\" a fundamental principle of filmmaking. As a result, it feels like enduring a lecture rather than being invited into a story.Misguided Gender Dynamics: My discomfort extends to the portrayal of gender dynamics within the film.Art Direction vs. Experience: It\\'s undeniable that \"Barbie\" is a feast for the eyes. The art direction is nothing short of amazing, bringing to life the iconic doll\\'s universe with a kaleidoscope of colors and imaginative design. However, this visual achievement feels hollow in the wake of a narrative that struggles to match its depth with substance. The beauty of the film\\'s aesthetics becomes overshadowed by a viewing experience marred by its preachy tone and missed opportunities for nuanced storytelling.In conclusion, while \"Barbie\" (2023) may be a landmark in visual storytelling, its reliance on overt messaging and a skewed portrayal of gender dynamics detracts from its potential as a film. The brilliance of its art direction is unfortunately not enough to save the viewer from a less-than-stellar experience. A movie, regardless of its good intentions or bad, must first and foremost captivate its audience through the art of storytelling, something that \"Barbie\" struggles to achieve amidst its preachy narrative and controversial themes.',\n",

It's touching and I'm sure many will relate wether people want to admit to it or not. (This movie isn't about a perfect doll)That being said if you don't like musicals you might not love this movie there are quite a few numbers in this film.

              "  'As a movie enthusiast and a long-time Barbie fan, I was intrigued to watch \"Barbie\". This film is not just a typical Barbie story - it\\'s a cinematic masterpiece that beautifully blends fantasy and reality.The first thing that struck me was the film\\'s technical excellence. The seamless transition between the vibrant Barbie Land and real-world scenes was done masterfully. It added depth to the narrative, elevating it from a kids\\' movie to a thought-provoking film.The highlight for me was the bold exploration of feminism. The film did not tiptoe around this topic, making it culturally relevant and significant. The blend of serious discussions with light-hearted humor was impressive, offering a fresh take on the classic Barbie tale.The characters were memorable and relatable. Barbie and Ken, in particular, were portrayed with a mix of exaggerated humor and genuine emotion. The film articulated a powerful message about self-identity and the struggle between maintaining perfection and dealing with life\\'s complexities.However, there were aspects I found disappointing. The narrative moved away from Barbie Land too quickly, leaving me wanting more. Also, the film\\'s constant self-reference to its cleverness felt overdone after a while.Despite these minor flaws, \"Barbie\" surpasses expectations. Its technical brilliance, feminist undertones, and the balance of humor and emotion make it a must-watch. It\\'s a unique take on the Barbie world, and I highly recommend it.',\n",

However, i was not disappointed in the film, and especially by the performance of Margot Robbie, who had already made a big splash with her quirky and entertaining Suicide Squad role. Ryan Gosling is fine as Ken, but I thought that another actor might have been a more appropriate choice, as Gosling is a fine dramatic actor, but is not really noted for satire or comedy.The director refrains from making the film too preachy for the majority of the movie, but sometimes lets the film bog down a bit during the transitions of Barbie Land throughout the film. None of the secondary characters were really too memorable. Other than that, the film is entertaining, and a pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon at the movies.',\n",
              "  'I say this without a shred of irony; Greta Gerwig\\'s Barbie is undoubtedly the film we so desperately need right now. This is the movie of our time - a film that shows us what life and society are like now, as well as shows us how we can do better. Plus, the movie is pure joy! It\\'s a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. This is the most fun I\\'ve had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to Gerwig\\'s incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.This movie is so hard for me to review... because it\\'s just SO GOOD! Like oh my god go see it right now, it\\'s incredible, important, and so much fun! Genuinely, it\\'s the most fun I\\'ve had at a movie in a long time - it\\'s filled with pure joy and hope! Barbie exceeded all my expectations and completely lives up to the hype surrounding it! Honestly, it\\'s pretty much a perfect film! I had a freaking blast with the movie - I loved everything it did! It\\'s pretty much the funnest movie ever!As I write this review and reflect on the film, I had the sudden urge to revisit Greta Gerwig\\'s breakout directorial effort; Lady Bird, and was struck by how strong and unique a voice Gerwig has as a filmmaker. Having seen her take on Little Women and now Barbie, I can easily say she is one of the most interesting and talented filmmakers working today! I\\'m super impressed with Gerwig as a filmmaker - all her movies are completely different and she has avoided being placed in a box. The film industry wants you to do what they know you can do very well - it wants to place filmmakers in a box, labeling someone as only a horror filmmaker, another who only does comedies, etc. Because of her ability to do LOTS of different things very well, she has been able to avoid being labeled as only one thing, making her one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. She has shown herself to be very versatile - truly on the level of Spielberg. She\\'s easily one of the greatest of her generation. I also really love how she isn\\'t afraid to tackle complex social issues in her films, and she somehow always manages to find really profound and interesting ways to communicate her messages. She blends social commentary with story to the point that a scene can be both emotional and profound while also hilarious and entertaining at the same time! Gerwig is also a very economical, smart storyteller - every shot, action, and line of dialogue tells us something about character or story, nothing is wasted! Plus, Gerwig seems to be endlessly creative and really commits to her visions. I\\'ve become a huge fan of Gerwig\\'s work and Barbie has just solidified my love for her as a filmmaker!Greta Gerwig\\'s work in Barbie is the literal definition of innovative and insightful direction with an actual authentic voice and vision to back it up. If the movie is honoured, she better come along with it. It all starts with her, and in anyone else\\'s hands, it all falls flat. What could\\'ve been a soulless, superficial cash grab becomes something so singular, subversive, and stirring. No one could make this movie like her. She IS the movie.The secret weapon of Barbie is that magic ability Gerwig has as a writer and director to strike such a perfect balance between message and entertainment, which is something that is incredibly hard to do! Don\\'t expect this film to be just another toy brand adaptation like the Transformers films, this is not forgettable, mindless entertainment. Barbie is trying to teach us something and has lessons that people need to hear. The commentary isn\\'t heavy-handed or forced at all, it feels natural and, in fact, the way they comment on gender roles, masculinity and femininity, and the stereotypes of those is a lot of fun while also making you think! Like the best comedies, it is able to layer in commentary to all of the humour - the film has a really healthy sense of humour for all the themes it is exploring! I just absolutely love that in a given scene I could be laughing so hard, and yet also really engaging with the thematic and emotional material in that same scene to the extent that I did. Scenes would be both really funny and yet deep and insightful at the same time; it\\'s very rare a film with this strong a message is this entertaining! My god Greta Gerwig is a master! Even the humour was so well done - it was so unexpected and willing to do anything! I loved it! It was a combination of both high and low-brow humour; I loved the goofiness and the slapstick elements to it, but also really loved that it managed to balance this over-the-top humour with really clever wordplay and more subtle, dryly delivered dialogue! And the fact it never took away from the seriousness or importance of a scene was just stunning to me! You can really tell Gerwig and Noah Baumbach had a lot of fun writing this one - and I\\'m amazed Mattel and Warner Bros allowed them to get away with some of the things they did!Though Barbie is largely silly and satirical (and yes, a \"studio movie\"), there are so many moments where Greta Gerwig\\'s singular style shines and it takes your breath away - one of the most unforgettable moments in the film is Barbie on the bench, experiencing every human emotion for the first time. (You\\'ll know it when you see it.) I think scenes like this show that, while Barbie does have a lot to say about womanhood and coming-of-age as a woman in a complicated and contradictory world, it\\'s ultimately just as much about what it means to be alive and be a human in general. And no one is excluded from that. (Men, I\\'m looking at you.)I know a lot of guys might not think they are part of the target audience for the film. But trust me, I\\'m a guy, and I LOVED it. I connected with so many of the themes and loved getting to see my girlfriend connect with even more of them. This movie is for everyone. Sure, women will identify with it in some areas a lot more than others will, but there is much to offer for everyone else. This movie is a film everyone needs to see, and everyone would enjoy it if they gave it a chance! Trust me, go in with an open mind and I promise you won\\'t be disappointed.The film tells a really moving story about what it means to be a woman in today\\'s world, and you really don\\'t have to be a woman to be moved by it! The screenplay and themes are so well done and get better and better as the film goes on as the deeper layers begin to reveal themselves. It\\'s truly beautiful and so heartfelt - there is so much love in this movie for women and mothers! And really when it comes down to it, this is pretty much a story about finding yourself. It\\'s about gender roles in society and the societal construct and expression of those roles. It\\'s about how we cope and exist with models, role models, and other influences in society. It\\'s a breakdown of Barbie (the doll) - what she did for the world that was both good and bad, and how she could possibly help it moving forward. Gerwig wasn\\'t afraid to rip apart the way in which Barbie is an outdated concept and represents the worst of what we think gender means, such as how it has negatively influenced body image standards for women. Gerwig also ponders the extent that the legacy of Barbie has contributed to or detracted from feminist movements - has Barbie empowered women or instead created outdated stereotypes? Greta Gerwig almost did too good of a job for Mattel! I can\\'t believe Mattel agreed to this, it very much critiques them and Barbie at times. It\\'s just such a smart movie and manages to cover all these topics and themes in such a natural and entertaining way without ever feeling forced!And oh my god! America Ferrera has such a powerful monologue in the film about how women have to try to navigate society and I haven\\'t been able to stop thinking about it since I saw the film. It\\'s one of the most profound pieces of writing I\\'ve seen in quite a while and it\\'s delivered beautifully. Probably the part of the movie that\\'s stuck with me the most since watching it. It\\'s sending an important message to the audience while also allowing the film\\'s narrative to move forward smoothly and efficiently. And I can\\'t even imagine how much it will mean to all the women and girls who see the film - I know it really meant a lot to my girlfriend and has allowed many women to feel seen! America Ferrera is the film\\'s beating heart and luminous soul, she gives such a genuinely moving performance and a show-stopping monologue that had the audience applauding. No one can write a monologue like Greta Gerwig!As I said, the film meant a lot to my girlfriend, and I wanted to include these thoughts she had after we saw it, as I think it really shows how truly important the message of this film is:\"Barbie is a movie about growing up and realizing womanhood isn\\'t all pink, pleasure, and possibility. Realizing that much of the world will hate you - always - no matter what you do, simply because of who you are. Realizing that there comes a point when you either have to accept complacency within the patriarchy, or ostracization and vilification outside of it.Or, maybe there\\'s another way. Maybe womanhood isn\\'t all the fun and freedom dreamed up in youth, but maybe we don\\'t have to abandon it entirely either. Maybe, just maybe, once we accept and begrudgingly embrace the often brutal reality of our everyday existence - while still retaining our inner strength at the same time - we can better reconcile all these cultural complications and contradictions and find a way to move through the world cautiously, but authentically. Revelling in our - and the world\\'s - flaws instead of willfully overlooking them in favour of the fantasy.',\n",
              "  'The absolute best thing about this movie, is that it drives *exactly* the right people up a wall. In truth, it is neither as frivolous as it outwardly appears, nor nearly as socially progressive as it wants to be. And it\\'s certainly not as clever as it thinks it is. Supporting characters played by Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell are basic, and frankly unnecessary. As for the humor, only a few lines land. \"I\\'m a man without power, does that make me a woman?\" was one of the few. The 2001 opening was cute. The railway joke I\\'d seen on social media, and thought that was good, but in the film it just felt like they were trying a little *too* hard to be clever. I appreciate it, but I just don\\'t feel they committed enough to that tack.On the plus side, there\\'s never going to be a time when watching Margot Robbie is going to be a chore. She is wonderfully charming, and does a great job making the character and film work as much as it does. America Ferrera also does a great job, and has the only real scene of strident messaging to bother (those people who try hard to be bothered by such things). But, that is the point-of-view of the film, and what the filmmakers wants to portray. More power to them.As for the \"plot\\' such as it is, it\\'s really just another fish-out-of-water, or even, body-switch trope, with the added metaphysical dimension of reality vs. Fantasy. Which is what put me in mind of Purple Rose of Cairo. A film with a broader, less directed, female empowerment message, but a similar contrast of harsh reality and idealized fantasy. Pink Rose of Cairo.',\n",

She and partner Noah Baumbach have taken the Barbie mythos and built a multilayered narrative around the evolving nature of female identity and empowerment within the context of male dominance and the patriarchy that has defined sexual roles since the beginning of time. However, this is neither a treatise nor a polemic. It's still primarily a fun, free-wheeling farce with Day-Glo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective. Margot Robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives Ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity. The rest of the cast appear equally game. Gerwig has truly applied a perceptive twist to a candy-coated girlhood memory.\",\n",

It is like the Lego Movie where there's the world based on the toys of the real world and they interact with each other and the two worlds recognize each other to some degree. Barbie does have some sexual innuendos which doesn't make it the best for younger audiences like the Lego Movie would be.This movie is definitely not for everyone but definitely can appeal to many people.

I loved the characters as well! Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed it, I have to say. Respect for Alan!On the other hand, I felt like it could've improved in... fluidity. By that, I mean there were rigid transitions (such as when Barbie enters the real world) that are too fast or either too slow.

I watched the movie alone surrounded by teenagers who cheered when the WB logo appeared in pink.The conditions were set for this to go wrong, but Gerwig's vision for Barbie won me over. The film starts in the perfect, goofy, and funny Barbie Land, but it doesn't take long to move to the real world. Curiously, while most of the action in the real world works well, it's also where I felt some issues, mainly with the Mattel executives' characters. Let's say it was the only time I felt that the silliness of the film (and it's indeed very silly) went too far. The third act wraps everything up perfectly, with some fantastic speeches and a strong conclusion. Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie, but there's a big surprise in America Ferrera, and Ryan Gosling steals all the attention whenever he's on screen. All the supporting cast is hilarious.Younger audiences will love the colours, the incredible production design, and the light tone. However, this is a very adult film in the themes it addresses, managing to be highly relevant without ever ceasing to entertain.

Its not \"dark, weird, and crazy\" to have thoughts about death. That was just a strange choice. Margot Robbie had the best performance by far.I really think the movie aims for a message of equality so its kinda contradictory that the resolution in barbieland is a woman-run government. I get what they\\'re doing. I get its not a real place. But then why make a joke about letting the men have a few seats in the lower courts, when four women sit on the supreme court today.

I saw many people saying they thought it was an amazing portrayal but for someone who isn't in this demographic, it just seems a little tone deaf.

When I went out of the cinema, I felt so empowered and self-confident!Kudos to Greta Gerwig and her entire team for creating such a vital movie for women.Another important fact is that the actors and actresses absolutely nailed it!!! Margot Robbie played her role so well, I was actually convinced she was Barbie, and Ryan Gosling had the absolute best facial expressions. I enjoyed watching them sooo much. Worthy to mention is also the awesome work of the other actors and actresses: THEY WERE ALL AMAZING!!! Whoever did the casting for this movie should get a raise.

But it\\'s mainly about an existential crisis for the main Barbie (Margot Robbie), who travels to the \"Real World\" to resolve her crisis. Events in both the \"Real World\" and the Barbie world drive the plot, which concerns the collision between the ideal and the real. The dramatic conflict centers on the contradiction between the ideal world of the Barbies and the disappointing, yet also tempting, reality of our world--the Real World.

But it was pure illusion.First, I\\'d like to praise Margot Robbie\\'s performance, truly sublime, she carries the film alone, as the rest leaves a lot to be desired. It leaves something to be desired as comedy, romance and fantasy, as a political, social and existentialist content, and, above all, as a children\\'s film.I found the very inclusive cast excellent, but the ideological proposal of 90% adult fantasy, from the sarcastic jokes, through the existentialist issues of life and death, to the political and social themes, leaving the fantasy, lightness and romance in a plane below zero, everything in the film was made for a 14+ audience, well above Barbie\\'s native audience. Not that I don\\'t consider the themes interesting, yes, I like adult jokes and I value important gender and other agendas, and, yes, here in Barbie they should be included, but as subliminal themes to spark interest in a child, and not as an adult fantasy script.And why do I say that? Because my 5-year-old daughter, like many girls between 4 and 10 years old, has always been a fan of Barbie, she has watched all the cartoons more than 20 times each one, and when for the first time a live action version of the beloved doll appears, it\\'s not made for children brains. It\\'s difficult, for example, to explain to my daughter the fun of a joke about plastic and real vaginas and penises, or why Barbie melancholically philosophizes about death, or so many other things on that adult level of sarcasm that the film proposes. Disappointing.',\n",
              "  'Any time a movie prioritizes messaging, there\\'s an all too long history of the end result suffering, whether in terms of its storytelling, its general craftsmanship, or both. Broadly, this trend holds true even when a message is important, admirable, and agreeable. Case in point, last year\\'s slasher \\'They/them\\' was troubled in various ways, but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging; sure enough, the writing suffered in turn. This 2023 film is not free of that same issue, for it is extremely, emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey; they\\'re terrific ideas, but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly, indisputably, what the script wants to communicate. More than that, this is a picture that strives to be, say, and do a lot, and in fact it is, says, and does so much that it\\'s a little overwhelming - I earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus. And though I somewhat repeat myself, it\\'s well worth accentuating that the feature is majorly heavy-handed, with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate, nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves. It\\'s a title that wears its neon pink heart on its sleeve, and there\\'s no possibility of missing it.And yet what\\'s truly amazing is that for all this, \\'Barbie\\' is also a movie that is incredibly, exceptionally smart. I can\\'t readily think of any other title that was so predominantly blunt, gawky, and straightforward in its presentation, but which simultaneously impressed with the absolute supreme intelligence behind everything that\\'s being shoved in our faces. Within the slant of being overfull and immoderate, it\\'s nevertheless remarkably well-rounded and balanced. Everything it endeavors to be, say, and do is treated with that same frank hand, and all is blended together into a slurry where no facet is allowed to especially outshine the others. It bounces from trenchantly triumphant to awesomely artificial, to wildly wacky, to dourly dispiriting, to honestly heartfelt, to satisfyingly sincere, and back again, but the progression still feels natural and meaningful, not to mention purposeful, and we never experience whiplash. It is entirely unabashed about the values it wields like a flaming sword of vengeance, and the themes that serve as its very blood: feminism, independence, denunciation of patriarchy and toxic masculinity; self-discovery and self-realization outside any strict confines or definitions that are forced upon or underhandedly given to us, or which we unwittingly construct for ourselves; the need to be active agents of our own liberation, active defenders of what we wish to build, and active stewards of what we wish to maintain - and much, much more. Then, too, it plainly champions diversity even in just the casting, but ultimately acknowledges the advisable place and just importance of diversity, and equality, in governance and representation; touches upon the evils of capitalism, and also the multifaceted elements of what Mattel\\'s signature doll represents, for good and for ill; recognizes that women, who can and should be anything they want, can be and may want to be mothers, too. It\\'s not inaccurate to say that \\'Barbie\\' acts to upholds what are commonly seen as leftist or humanist ideals, yet those who decry the feature as part of some subversive agenda either haven\\'t actually seen it, or can\\'t discern the immediately transparent notion that values that seek a better, more equitable world for everyone can only be said to be dangerous insofar as they threaten those values that work to sustain inequality and injustice.Meanwhile, setting aside the writing which is so enormously essential to all that this is, the film is stupendously well done in every other regard. The cast is a blast, simply put, obviously all having a fantastic time - but for as weird and widely varied as the parts and scenes may be, everyone also gives excellent performances no less worthy of appreciation than anything else that any of them have done. It rather goes without saying that Margot Robbie is altogether luminous as the stereotypical protagonist, but I personally am also very happy to see Hari Nef here so prominently, and Kate McKinnon is an outright joy. The crew put in magnificent work in every last regard, from spellbinding, colorful sets, to bewitching costume design, to impeccable hair and makeup, and more. Editing, cinematography, direction, sound, stunts, effects: I do not jest when I say that everything here looks fabulous. The music is a wonderfully fun garnish that I in no way anticipated, and all who contributed to the soundtrack in any way are to be congratulated; those instances of choreography that we see are utterly superb, providing a level of glee that I\\'d have never supposed even based on advance marketing. And as if all the huge, concrete ideas behind the screenplay weren\\'t enough, the story in and of itself is genuinely entertaining and compelling, let alone highly rewarding. The scene writing is marvelously strong, rich, and varied, keeping the proceedings fresh and engaging from start to finish; the dialogue and characters are as shrewdly penned as anything else in these two hours. What here is not brilliant, when all is said and done? Well, I gave my answer when I first sat down, but even if it\\'s not flawless, the imperfections here are less about any discrete weaknesses or shortcomings and more about how stunningly busy the script is, stuffed to the proverbial gills and nearly straining to keep itself together even in the face of so much skill and wit. And if that\\'s the worst that I can say about a picture, then I\\'d say it\\'s done darn well for itself indeed.The promise of a star-studded cast, filled with persons I admire, and the involvement of an esteemed filmmaker and her partner, did nothing to quell skepticism when news first surfaced of a live-action Barbie movie on the big screen. The first teaser and subsequent trailer elicited much favor, but still I had my reservations, wondering above all how the same dazzling energy could possibly be sustained for a full-length feature. Then, to be frank, there came the swift, abrasive reactions from certain people - reactions that were laughably alarmist and apoplectic, not to mention outlandish and unreasonable. Suffice to say that such breath-taking reactions were the tipping point for me, as they elevated Greta Gerwig\\'s \\'Barbie,\\' from \"a film I might like to check out if I have the chance,\" to a must-see. And now that I have? While all my doubts have been erased and I could hardly be more pleased, I can also safely say that this is not the movie I was expecting. That riotous energy of the teaser and trailer isn\\'t here for the whole runtime (though, most of it, certainly). What we get as complement and in its place, though, is masterful mindfulness and craftsmanship, and a jarring, somewhat backhanded, but very welcome and refreshing, wholehearted sincerity that is all the more smarter for the ways in which, sights unseen, it\\'s kept hidden. Ironically, I ponder if this isn\\'t too lofty in its writing, possibly going over the heads of those who might benefit most from what it has to offer. Even if that\\'s true, though, this is so splendidly well done that it will hold up indefinitely, and be something to revisit time and again, both for those who want to see what we may have missed before, and to ensure that its message reaches the widest possible audience. When I was younger I\\'d never have thought a Barbie flick could be this good and substantive, but here we are: Gerwig\\'s picture is well worth watching, and earns my very high, hearty recommendation.',\n",

Entertaining throughout the movie even if it is mostly predictable. Great message even if it gets preachy a little bit, which surely is going to invite a lot of hate towards it too. It also shows different sides of the kind of issues in our world by juxtaposition. The self-awareness works to a point too. But the constant and blatant toy promotion kind of makes the whole thing almost pointless.

But the entire plot of the story was all over the place, leaving me feeling little to no empathy for the characters, albeit Ken. Now Ryan Gosling MADE this movie. Though at times, I wasn't sure if he was supposed to be the antagonist or puppy dog we were supposed to sympathize with. What really got to me about this movie were the stereotypes, which just contradicted the entire message. Scenes that were meant to be moving fell flat. Characters had very little development.

In fact, when Barbie is mentioned, the role is well-accepted. Of course, Barbie is not the only character fully reflected in the movie. By writing Ken as a one-dimensional character and inserting a prominent role in the story, he significantly increased the directors of the movie games. Ryan Gosling had a great acting. Frankly, he manages to steal the heart of television in every scene on the screen. For the other Barbie and Ken players, the states didn't show much of a performance (Maybe Kate McKinnon). There were no such important scenes anyway. But America Ferrera didn't do a great job despite having a very available house.

Greta Gerwig\\'s movie seemingly let us tap into all of that and more thanks to a great PR team that I haven\\'t seen work their magic since a long long time, in other words hype has been BUILT. How does it fare? I left the cinema with a smile but I wish that it could have something MORE. Let me explain down below.Barbie is a movie that is about Barbie, the doll, the idea, living in a world separate from reality called Barbieland a world where Barbie is everything, from the president to a Nobel prize laureate to a doctor. She runs this world in all her iterations, until the stereotypical Barbie somehow gets thoughts about death, she gets a flat foot (CHAOS!) and she gets cellulites (THE HORROR!)- she has to fix this by travelling in the real world with Ken and in this she meets a hard working mother and her cynical daughter- fun hijinks galore!This movie has got the aesthetics DOWN, like it\\'s so pretty and so meticulously done with all the details, to how the actors act and how the worlds are built- this is more on how the Barbie world is, because when it mixes with the real world. That\\'s where things get a bit complicated.Example; There\\'s no actual \"real\" separation between Barbieland or the real world, meaning that the real world feels like a mirror flipped version of Barbieland where people act just as outlandish as the titular dolls. I kinda wish that Greta would\\'ve made a script that actually puts Barbie in real world, how it is right now, and I know that Greta is great at making reality feel relatable and recognisable and human but I felt there was not much of a difference. Maybe it was so that they could fill the whole Mattel-company storyline in it? Either way I wish that Greta would play more with these contrasts and fish-out-of-water-feelings.This in turn makes the other characters that should be relatable for the moviegoers- i.e. The daughter and the mother feel painfully flat and just unnecessary for the story overall, despite making them \"deep\" they felt honestly super flat, like dolls and stereotypes of characters in a movie. And I don\\'t think that was Greta\\'s intention, not if you see the movies that she\\'s done before where there\\'s always a singular perspective but here I think she\\'s kind of confused on who to use the perspective the most on. Luckily it is Barbie and Ken for the most of the movie, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are doing a fantastic job at playing these characters and it\\'s in their moments where the comedy shines the most.Another missed opportunity generally I think is just addressing the gay history that is tied to the Barbie brand. And how gay men like me were influenced by it- not to say that this was absolutely important for a movie like this but I still feel like it would\\'ve made sense, at least the gay doll of 90s Ken (who was made popular in the 90s due to being bought by mostly gay men) made an appearance, if only briefly. I know, I shouldn\\'t make demands about this but I feel like there would\\'ve been something even more interesting with addressing all the boys that play with Barbie dolls, the \"real world\" feels very black and white in this sense. But I regress, this is just a tangent and a thought!I love the comedic and camp elements, I think they are what sustain the movie and the fashion of course. Also I love that it brings forth the themes of feminism as that is needed in a movie like this, I think that it does so in a great manner. Is it the movie that I wanted? Not really, but I\\'m glad that it exists, I\\'m glad that I saw it. Maybe I was too much swayed by the whole PR marketing strategy but I really wanted this to be a new camp and fun fun classic. Instead it feels just good and that\\'s ok. I wanted it to be more of an adult-oriented movie and maybe that\\'s where Greta kind of flubbed it, trying to make it both kid and adult friendly but she honestly doesn\\'t succeed at neither and that\\'s alright.',\n",

I think that the last bits of the movie were a little too talky and they just talked and talked about feminism and it was a little bit boring there.

These movie is about existational crisis, finding who you are and your purpose.And they do that amazingly good. In the end you just understand the character and you touched by her story. I cry at the end and I didn't expect that at all. In the end she just discovers that she doesn't need to be Barbie, she can be whoever she wants, this beautiful.

But just ALMOST.Barbie tries to be a society critic, an advert film, a comedy, a kids movie, and it almost works well in those types. But there are some bad things I want to discuss, so here's how this critic will work, I will show how it fits in the types I written down, and after that I will write the conclusion.Society Critic Part: The movie absolutely great in this type, it both shows the stupidity of the PC world, and the terrifying fact we live in a world where is homophobia and racism, sexism. Most of the jokes are about that.Advert Film Part: Exactly because the Society Critic part, it fails to be a good advert film, because who do you want to want to get Barbies. Small Children! And small children will not understand, the jokes with our society, they understand the slapstick jokes. Okay there's some in the film. But there's too few to interest a child.Comedy Part: It's good. This movie IS funny. I can't say more.Kids Movie Part: As I said, it's not working that much. But I have to tell, it can be a bit too silly for adults. So that's a problem too.Conclusion: It's a good movie ! Watch it max two times, great stuff. But if it wasn't a Barbie movie, it could work better.\",\n",

I have been watching movies for so many years and I have seen everything, but in recent years the movies are becoming more and more disappointing. I was very happy that the movie attracted people to the cinema, I also went to see Oppenhaimer and it was wonderful but really, this movie is completely forgettable.

              "  'This movie was not what I expected at first, but I loved it. It\\'s been years since I watched a new big budget movie that was so bright and fun with its own sense of logic. Taika Waititi said in an interview that Hollywood (particularly superhero) movies have gotten so dark and when he was a kid he went to the cinema to escape the darkness of life. I feel like Barbie could be the start of the un-darkening of Hollywood movies.As a woman with some trauma, I love a good gritty woman-run movie that talks about how life feels as a woman in a man\\'s world. Sometimes though, you just want some feel-good escapism that isn\\'t forcing you to watch the female protagonist go through all sorts to get the message across.I\\'ve seen other reviews say that a lot of the movie didn\\'t make sense. I feel like the way they executed it made sense for a Barbie movie. I\\'ve also seen other reviews say that the feminist message of the movie missed the mark since Kens aren\\'t equal in Barbieland, I loved that part especially. In the same way that I don\\'t like feminine trauma being graphically shoved in my face in a movie for the sake of a thinly veiled message, I think it also sucks when a movie takes *too* light of an approach because it\\'s scared to actually say something. Of course the Kens aren\\'t equal in Barbieland 1) Ken was literally invented as a boyfriend for Barbie because parents thought a single lady with a job was \"loose\" and 2) they are toys made by people, they are a product (lol) of their makers. So yes, Barbies are in charge, but Barbieland is just another world created by men and the ideology of misogyny (or any form of bigotry) states that someone can only be dominant if someone else is subservient.The audience in the theatre I was in seemed to feel the same way, because when the narrator said, \"Well, the Kens have to start somewhere. Eventually they\\'ll have as much rights as women have in the real world.\" I swear everyone was laughing. It really connected with the audience from what I saw. So many clever points were made in a nonsensical Barbie pink package and it was just perfect. If you made it this far on my review, you\\'re going to have the best day ever today. And tomorrow.

              "  \"Barbie is undoubtedly an exceptionally unique film, expressing an appreciation for art and beauty, with visible brilliance behind a carefully crafted script aimed at sending a message, enriched by elements of comedy and irony.The plot revolves around the protagonist Barbie, who was expelled from Barbieland for not conforming to the beauty and perfection standards imposed by the perfect world. Upon entering our world, she discovers that reality is very different from what she imagined, facing sexism and gender inequality. This leads her to reconsider how society should handle differences, especially gender-related ones.The film manages to balance animation and emotion, maintaining a focus on the comedy while also delving into deep drama, particularly when the protagonist confronts adversities in a society dominated by patriarchy.The setting of the work is highly immersive, enhanced by the intelligent direction of Greta Gerwig and the captivating performances of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. This results in a film that captivates the viewer's attention and effectively conveys the necessary emotions.However, due to the dialogues, the film becomes quite obvious, leaving little room for artistic interpretations or for the audience to absorb the message in a more personal way. This makes the work, as it approaches the end, somewhat predictable and, to some extent, unnecessary, considering that the message was delivered from the beginning.\",\n",
              "  'The Margot Robbie/Ryan Gosling curiosity BARBIE is a subversive film. This Greta Gerwig directed move lures you in by presenting a farcical/satirical look at the pastel colored \"Barbieland\" and the myriad of outfits and \"golly-gosh\" goodness of the world of this iconic Mattel doll (and her boyfriend, Ken). Once you are comfortably settled into this world, you are transformed to the \"real world\" and the much deeper themes of a women\\'s place in a patriarchal world.As another toy\\'s slogan puts it, \"there\\'s more than meets the eye\" to this film.And one should have expected something more than just a \"surfacey-fun\" film from the Writer/Director of such fare as LADYBIRD and FRANCES HA. Gerwing uses the stereotypes of Barbie and Ken to take a look at our society and the inherent hierarchy of the sexes while peeling back the layers of the key players to make them more than the plastic dolls they portray.And...it works surprisingly well for adults - not so much for kids.Margot Robbie, of course, is perfectly cast as the titular Barbie. She has the looks and the vacuous devil-may-care attitude of \"Stereotype Barbie\" and is a comfortable, pleasing entity to share this adventure with. But, with Gerwig\\'s direction, Robbie\\'s performance reveals, subtly, layer after layer until - at the end - we end up with a full fledged character and not just a living doll.Ryan Gosling is just as strong as Barbie\\'s counterpart, Ken. He morphs from a Barbie worshipping boyfriend to something else once he encounters the real, male-dominated world. The BankofMarquis wondered why Gosling would agree to do a film that, on it\\'s surface, appears to be a one-note joke-fest, but once the film really drives to it\\'s point, one can see why Gosling agreed to be in this.Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Michael Cerra, Helen Mirren (as the narrator) and America Ferrara all spark - at times - during this film while it was good to see Rhea Perlman (Carla on CHEERS) have a role that she could sink her teeth into.Only Will Ferrell - as the money hungry CEO of Mattel - falls short of interesting. His character - one of the only \"real world\" characters in this film - stays stereotypical throughout the movie. He is the only complete caricature in this film...and perhaps that is on purpose.Credit for the surprising depth of this film goes to Gerwig who brings her sensibilities to this film to make a comment on our society. It\\'s a bold move by Gerwig and works well...unless you are a Mom that is bringing your 5 or 6 year old child to this film.And, that is the caution to this movie. It\\'s not, necessarily, made for the youngsters that play with Barbies. The kids will love the early going of this film, but the more adult themes in the middle of the movie will probably make a good deal of them squirm in their seats, since these moments of depth will go over their heads.A surprisingly fun...and deeper than it appears to be....film, this Barbie is a multi-level dreamhouse.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the BankofMarquis.',\n",

This movie manages to capture the right amount of feminism without taking itself so seriously. The standout performance is Ryan Gosling as Ken; I think he carried his role with the perfect amount of Kenergy. Margot Robbie is delightful as Barbie and gives her much heart.I think the movie would've worked better as a tv series to allow the writers to flesh out the characters a bit more. It would've been better if we understood more of what created the distance between Gloria and her daughter (See? I can't even remember her name). When did Barbie first start feeling that she wanted more than the same existence everyday. Why weren't the Barbies and Kens capable of understanding more than their world? Didn't their characters encompass their human counterparts?Anyway....the movie was fun, lighthearted and something for everyone to enjoy.\",\n",

His musical number was fantastic.Aspects of it reminded me of Pleasantville, PeeWee Herman's Big Adventure, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and even a bit from the Matrix - some interesting associations.Overall kinda liked the movie but can only give it a fair rating. The Mattel chasing subplot was superfluous and detracting coupled with the slow start needing rework. Could have used better conflict focus and editing on the story I think.

Barbie promises one thing, and that one thing that it promises to be, is a personification, of a Barbie doll that little girls have been playing with sense she was made 80 years ago.The movie also learns about female experience, it's also about feminism, and men needs to understand how woman feel, and truly needs to know how they feel. And I gotta say, this movie learns so well, and tells a very good story, and how well it performs in the movie.Greta Gerwig did a fabulous job directing, and making this movie, and she earns the spotlight in filmmaking history, along with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling and the rest of the Cast and Crew!If you like Barbie, or if you don't like Barbie, then this is the movie for you to watch in the cinemas!10/10.\",\n",

It delivers amazing performances from the whole cast, Robbie and Gosling with unmatched chemistry, Ferrera's monologue and everybody else.The message is clear, how it is to be a woman in this reality, a mother, a daughter.. feminism seems superficial but it gives a powerful insight on the matter. Greta managed to tell us how impactful Barbie has been to little girls who dream of being whatever they want but she also criticises how damaging the doll can be to self-conscious girls.She exploits the famous figure to make fun of the patriarchy. At first it can be interpreted as a product of capitalism and stereotypes but you'll understand that the same Barbie is criticised in the movie for these same themes. This judgment is already solved in the message of the movie, Greta flips this concept using it to tell the story and its moral.It's camp, it's fun and it's pop.The script is smart and well written, it makes you laugh and sing and dance but all of it is balanced with profound conversation, Barbie and Ruth Handler, and with the amazingly and hurtfully sincere monologue by Gloria (Ferrera). There's a handful of cinema references, from Kubrick's 2001: space odyssey to The Wizard of Oz, there are jokes on movies that aren't to be taken to seriously, you'll find them funny.Jokes on fascism that are culturally genius and a rupture of the fourth wall that you'll absolutely agree with.It's not only a feminist message but Barbie expands its themes to Ken's character.

Unfortunately, in the real world, patriarchy exists and we're limited. I liked it didn't marry Barbie off to Ken or make her have to have a relationship to be happy.What I didn't like: The stereotypical treatment of men and the relegation of them back to second class citizens in Barbie land. That things got confusing and hard to follow. Why exactly were all Barbies instantly brainwashed but stereotypical Barbie?I wish they could have handled the gender issues in a way to enforce more equality between the Kens and the Barbies without necessarily marrying them all of in pairs. Maybe Ken finally does get his mojo dojo saloon just not by taking over Barbies dream house. He gets acknowledged and gets his space too. Maybe he hooks up with Midge because he moves on. Maybe he gets a beach house so he can Beach off whenever he wants. I don't know. It was funny. I laughed out loud several times. Glad I saw it. Just wish they went some different directions.\",\n",

What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.The sheer amount of details that are in this movie is amazing, from the clothes, the wide variety of dolls, cars, pets, houses, and even down to the accessories were a perfect match to what's being sold or what has been sold in the past. On another note, I was not expecting the plot twist and the antagonist to be revealed, but that's what I liked about this movie, I went in thinking to know what this movie was going to be about but I was wrong and was surprised. As the movie progresses you find yourself enjoying it more and more, it's well paced and it has a good story so I definitely recommend it!\",\n",

At the end I did not like it that much.Nothing can be said about the quality of acting to be honest. The actors did a tremendous job across the board. Margot was superb. A few of the supporting actors were also great. Gosling's portrayal of Ken was hilarious.I'm no expert in movie making but to me the set design, costume design overall making of the movie looked very good but the beef I have is with the story. To me it didn't felt good enough. It was weird to say the least. I know asking for logic is too much in this particular world but there should be some for it to be enjoyable. The events that took place in the real world was ridiculous to say the least.I was just thinking if all the big names were replaced with new actors who lets just say acted at the same level of the big names, would people even watch this and talk this highly about it? In my mind the answer was no.........And I guess that's enough to describe it.\",\n",

The music. Everything was perfect!Barbie addresses the real world in hopes of finding the girl who played with her but ends up embarking on more of a self discovery journey. The real world isn't what she thought it would be, and Barbie world has been taken over by the Kens. With teamwork and unlikely friendship, the Barbies are able to take back Barbieland. The feminism throughout this movie ROCKED. I loved how it didn't necessarily bash men, but it did shine a light on the the massive egotism that tends to overcome men and their logic. As well as their belief to be superior to women. The was the best movie of the entire year. And one do the best movies of the entire decade so far.On behalf all women everywhere, we thank you!!\",\n",

Regardless, it never lost the entertainment factor that a movie about Barbie should have - so I can only give props to the director and the actors.For the first few minutes, I was worried that the movie was going to be just \"stupid fun\" but as they progressed the plot, it got better and better - I think the resolution of both plotlines of Barbie and Ken were brilliant and quite satisfying.The highlight was the comedy, the relationship between the characters and their commentary about feminism, consumerism and patriarchy.',\n",
              "  'I didnt expected ill rate this movie at all.I just watched it and i totaly changed my opinion about this movie, and Barbies as a dolls. I never had a doll of a Barbie or Ken, bc i as man, when i was kid i didnt liked dolls, but this movie is much more than that.Before watching i had low expectations, because its a Barbie movie and bc of other comments i read, they were mostly negative, and now after watching the movie all of that negativity and low expectations just dissapeared.People whine about the story, but for me the story is well made. They put all positive and negative stuff about Barbies in a funny way, positive way.Main actors Margot (Barbie) and Ryan (Ken) + Will Ferrell were excellent choice for their role in this movie. I liked actually the role which W. Ferrell got, bc nobody could do that role better than him. He showed dark stuff as a CEO on a hilarious way and he alone lifted the whole movie for a very large amount. Both Margot & Ryan did their job very well for their roles. And even narator is well used.Im happy that this isnt just Barbie & Ken movie and that isnt a movie with some empty story. Near end it actually started to remind me on Pinocchio. Movie is inspiring and it can help some people if they have similar difficulties as Barbie did in their real lifes.I would give it a rating of 8, mostly bc i still dont like Barbies, bc im a man, but since im not rating the dolls, but the movie, and that same movie positively affected my night, then i will give it a 9.At least i can go to sleep now happier then i expected ill go.',\n",

Some people have claimed the movie posits a subversive anti-male agenda but I can\\'t see it that way. It\\'s simply a movie, based on a toy, that dares to actually not take itself seriously. Look at other films in this genre such as Battleship, GI Joe and the Transformers films. All take ludicrous concepts and imbue them with a ridiculous amount of dark \"realism\". Barbie doesn\\'t do that. It reveals that it\\'s a joke in the very first scene.Is this a great movie? Absolutely not. But it is fun, entertaining summertime fluff. Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both look and act perfectly plastic. The set design is brilliantly colorful and the whole thing moves at a pleasant pace. See it and enjoy.',\n",

The plot itself had some promise and there were some laughs but in general the movie was quite stupid.To start with there we're not enough big laugh moments and most of the humour was quite slapstick and lame. Secondly there seemed to be no real payoffs or explaining of choices. The only character who seemed to act in a way that was rationale was Ken, but even at the end he just gave up there was no conclusion so to speak of.The sets were quite fun and well thought out.

It's also completely hilarious and the cast is absolutely perfect. Almost No one else could play Barbie and Ken as good as Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling has.

Barbie starts off as a fun light hearted comedy movie. The first 30 mins are great! From then on the movie begins to have an identity crisis. It goes from deep feminist themes to a car commercial to a slide show to a 4th wall break depression Barbie ad and then a musical. One of my biggest problems was that I felt like the movie was talking to the audience too much. Things were being said or done visually in the movie not for the sake of the story but for the audience. Which maybe some people like but to me it kinda took me out of the experience.Barbie wanted to be taken seriously but because of its inability to be consistent and justify the actions of certain characters and events it left the audience behind.Like what is the purpose of Mr. Buisness(Will Ferrall)? Is he good? Is he evil? Does he care? Does he just want money? Why does he ask like a Barbie but he's from the real world?At the end of the day I agree with a lot of what was being said and the themes that were built. I just don't think the movie is for me... at all. But I didn't hate it and Ryan Gosling gets a üíØ/10.\",\n",
              "  'I was never into Barbie as a child because I thought she\\'s just a boring toy. The operative word being - toy. So when the controversy started about her impossibly small waist, sky high beauty standards, white skin and blonde hair, I thought some people just have too much time on their hands or because they\\'re just jealous at someone else\\'s success. It\\'s easier to blast someone else\\'s hard work rather than strike it out on your own and keep doing it.The way children perceive toys remain unchanged. A young child who picks up a Barbie will not immediately think (if at all) they must aspire to have the doll\\'s physique. Children play with toys out of enjoyment and by using their innocent imagination, they don\\'t think about the underlying message or intention behind every toy. The politicising comes from some adults who can scream the loudest and longest. Ruth Handler created Barbie after seeing her daughter playing with a paper doll, she wasn\\'t into politics or trying to change cultural standards.Gerwig\\'s Barbie is an example of an adult using a doll to scream her many, many lectures to the masses. The movie looks like it\\'s for children and teenagers but the script is the opposite. This is where it becomes confusing and the storyline thin. Too many speeches aiming at the patriarchy control, pointing out that it\\'s a sexist world controlled by men but showing all men in this movie as idiots.The portrayal of men is very black and white stereotyping. Barbie (Robbie) goes into the real human world and she\\'s heckled by men at the beach and if that\\'s not a clear enough message, she visits a construction site where, you guessed it, the men starts to make derogatory comments as well. Then there\\'s the Mattel HQ where it\\'s of course run by men in suits who are naturally, idiots. One of the lower ranked male employee (Swindells) even say, \"I\\'m a man with no power, does that make me a woman?\" (What\\'s with half of the Sex Education actors cast in this movie. The brilliant Ncuti Gatwa playing a hetero Ken!?)At just under two hours, you can guess why that is - there\\'s not much else going for it so the soundtrack plays a big part in driving the narrative to the point, you\\'re wondering if this is a movie or a music channel. The second half descends into a weird but clumsy attempt at humour that a child would find boring.Robbie and Gosling do a decent job with the flat material they were given. Barbie is an iconc doll and that\\'s all she is, a toy - so a movie keeping to that theme without the controversy would have been more entertaining. And in case you\\'re so numb from all the preachiness, the Trump and his wall sideswipe under a guise of a joke shows how the writers just wanted to cover as many \\'isms\\' as possible by using Barbie as a prop.',\n",

It is, in my opinion, the perfect movie length, at an hour and 54 minutes.Cinematography: 8.75- There are some really great cinematic shots throughout the film. Very clear distinction between \"Barbie Land\" and \"The Real World\".Acting- 9.75- The acting was wonderful. Every actor pulled their weight and shined. Many comedic moments that will have you laughing nearly to tears. Also, There are serious moments that are executed well in such a way that may even bring you to tears (as they did to me).Music Music Soundtrack: 9.5- Overall, extremely strong movie music soundtrack. All of the songs align with the theme of what is happening during the current scenes & the storyline. Great modern day popular artists chosen, including Lizzo, Dua Lippa, Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Sam Smith, Tame Impala, and others. The weakest song (and I mean from a vocal standpoint) is the one sung by Ryan Gosling.Choreography- 9- There is a fair amount of choreography in the film, and there is an all-Ken dancing scene that is phenomenal.Overall: 9.1/10.',\n",

              "  'Barbie was another movie that fell victim to its own hype. I was told several times that this movie was a must see so I had grand expectations going in. I was expecting a masterpiece. It was a piece, I\\'ll give it that.Barbie is a shattered utopia movie. You know the movie: the one in which everything begins perfectly and in harmony until something, however insignificant, breaks that harmony. Just think and I\\'m sure you can recall a movie. It doesn\\'t have to even be a societal utopia, it could just be the utopia of the main character him/herself like Ryan Reynolds in \"Free Guy.\"The shattered utopia in Barbie was Barbieland. There all the different Barbies of different ethnicities, different careers, and different sizes lived together in perfect harmony. Living among them were Kens who were also of different ethnicities but seemingly no careers or tasks whatsoever except to perhaps be accessories. Everyone was beautiful, happy, and worry free until Stereotypical Barbie (their words not mine), played by Margot Robbie, began having thoughts of death. These thoughts created small bits of imperfection which threatened all of Barbieland. To fix this issue, Barbie had to find her owner/player and fix what ailed her.She and Stereotypical Ken (Ryan Gosling) exited Barbieland into Los Angeles of the real world. There she met Gloria (America Ferrera) and Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), Gloria\\'s daughter, but that created more problems than it solved.What the smashed utopia ultimately brought about was knowledge of the existence of a patriarchy. A very hyperbolic patriarchy. That patriarchy would make its way back to Barbieland where Barbie, Gloria, and Sasha would have to try to restore the old order.\"Barbie\" definitely gets points for casting and the glamor and glitz. The line up was big time, featuring Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Dua Lipa, Kingsley Ben-Adir, John Cena, Michael Cera, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell. I still think that had I gone into this movie with no expectations, I would\\'ve like it more.Viewable on Max.',\n",

I\\'ve heard talks about this movie for YEARS, and it was different than I expected. I could recognize the performances were amazing and Greg blew it out of the park with the directing and writing and I had so much fun. But all I saw was a \"fun\" movie about \"being a women?\"...HOWEVER, after I left, I couldn\\'t stop thinking about it. Now that I knew the plot I felt I had to watch again to really understand what the movie was saying. So I watched it AGAIN, and I never go to the movies twice! I was BLOWN AWAY. Not only did I see so many details about the Barbie world but got a grasp of what Greta was saying about society l. About women. Men. Corporations. Mothers. Daughters. War.Do your self a favor. Watch it! Then, watch it again! Tbh I\\'m probably gonna see it one more time. I\\'ve only touched the surface.',\n",
              "  'Almost everyone should watch this movie, if for no other reason, to be part of the conversation. The topic of this movie often comes up in conversation and it is impossible to adequately summarize or explain the movie to anyone who has not seen it. \"The world of fantasy and make believe meets reality\" is not a unique narrative device but this film is unique in its approach to gender and unique in how it turns the \"Barbie\" stereotype on its head.Career driven women have often mocked the Barbie stereotype. Others have expressed contempt for it. The movie makes the point that in Barbie land, women can do anything and Ken is merely an accessory.As stereotypical Barbie (perfectly played by Margot Robbie) enters the portal to the real world (driving her Barbie mobile with Ken tagging along), Ken quickly realizes that men are in charge in the real world. Ken then promotes his naive understanding of \"stereotypical patriarchy\" which initially empowers him in a way he has never experienced in Barbie land.Ultimately, there is a clash of worlds, with once high powered Barbies (like \"President Barbie\") becoming accessories and merely ornamental in the patriarchy established by Ken in what becomes \"Kendom.\" These Barbies claim that being ornamental is fun and are diagnosed by \"Weird Barbie\" (the Barbie who was played with too much, played by Kate McKinnon) as being \"brainwashed. The human females, Weird Barbie & stereotypical Barbie set out to restore Barbieland to its former glory by taking the power back from the Kens who are portrayed as less intelligent than the Barbies. Ultimately, stereotypical Barbie and the humans realize that gender roles are complicated and that what matters is that everyone is true to herself. They also realize that the Kens should also be free to define themselves- not just in relation to the Barbies.There appears to be an effort to acknowledge that men and women do not have to be in conflict with each other and that life is messy.The set, the colors, the Barbie references are all worth watching. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are perfectly cast. There are some funny lines and scenarios. I appreciated the perspective of Barbie who can do anything in a world where women rule in contrast to the modern criticism of Barbie as representing a female stereotype which damages young girls. Ultimately, it was not clear to me what message the film was attempting to promote. Certainly, there have been plenty of films where the men were the smarter, more interesting characters so perhaps, this film aimed to balance that out. There is also an acknowledgment that life is complicated and that we should love and respect each other.',\n",

It's like a series of barely-connected skits.The characters are almost remarkably shallow and one-dimensional, with them all any depth or development whatsoever. Margot Robbie doesn't bring the charm she has exhibited in previous movies to this one and her character is annoying more than anything else.Additionally the songs are unremarkable and forgettable, with lyrics which lack any real meaning.It's also very boring and scenes seem to drag on for way longer than they should do, meaning that whenever something relatively interesting happens, which is rare, it carries on for so long it becomes dull again. It seems rushed and the editing feels weak. The humour just isn't there.There were some great actors involved with this, and to say that the set design is beautiful is an understatement, but I can't take to this film at all and in my opinion at least, it is overhyped.\",\n",

It\\'s a vibrant and delightful exploration into the world of one of the most enduring and iconic dolls ever created. Its storyline is compelling and keeps you engaged throughout, making it a truly wonderful movie.What makes the movie stand out is its successful use of humor and adventure that ensures it isn\\'t just another kids movie, but a family affair where adults can also derive enjoyment. Furthermore, the movie is brimming with fun characters that each add a unique flair to the narrative.A major highlight of the film is the character of Ken. He isn\\'t merely a supporting role, but emerges as a real scene-stealer. Ken\\'s charisma and witty dialogue delivery is splendid, adding a new layer to his character that audiences are sure to appreciate. His performance has a certain charm that makes you look forward to his scenes. Indeed, he truly stole the show.Despite the largely engaging narrative, the movie does come with a few plot holes. At times, the story lacks logic, and there are certain developments that seem a bit rushed or inadequately explained. However, considering that the movie is based on the universe of Barbie, where the rules of reality are often bent, these plot holes can be somewhat expected and forgivable.In conclusion, \"Barbie\" is an entertaining and heartwarming film that successfully captures the essence of its source material. Its flaws are minor and largely overshadowed by its vibrant characters, engaging narrative, and a particularly standout performance by Ken. Even with some plot holes, it\\'s a cinematic treat that offers plenty of enjoyment for both kids and adults.',\n",
              "  \"Barbie has captured many nuances of the societal stereotypes, challenged these tenets with a tactful yet fun twist. The main standout truly is the costume design. Highly diverse yet coherently put together to honor the Barbie concept. Borrowing elements from the Chanel's haute couture collection, to some of the rarest outfits from Barbie, it was such a unique experience to observe such understated works of art; even the extras/minor characters were wearing beautiful pieces. Some of the best costume design I've seen over the years.The plot was rather textbook, but definitely enjoyed the witty subtle jokes which created good tension and suspension. Well-balanced and great character development for most characters except for Sasha who changed opinions just too quickly for my taste.\",\n",
              "  'It is a film of absurd humour (which is funny in many moments) that criticises political models, fragile masculinity and society both past and present.The approach is to turn current society on its head and make Barbieland a world dominated by women, where they form the elite of society and the Kens are simply their boyfriends, irrelevant, unemployed, kept, objects. Basically what women are in the macho society.When Barbie and Ken arrive in the real world, Barbie realises that the world is upside down, that they are the objects and that the world is dominated by men, and Ken discovers the patriarchy and wants to carry it out in Barbieland. So far, the script and the critics are being perfect.After a lot of criticism of the hetero-male behaviour of men when it comes to flirting and leaving them to their basic behaviour, the critical moment arrives, the message of the film. The Barbies fight against patriarchy and supposedly don\\'t want to go back to the previous model where they ruled. I say SUPPOSEDLY, because they do go back to that model. One Ken asks the president of Barbieland if they can be part of the courts and the president\\'s answer is, yes, but from below and little by little.In the end the Barbies, after discovering the reality of the real world, adopt the same model. They do not accept the Kens as equals, NO, let them gradually integrate. Just as it has happened with women, who are gradually being removed from the wage and work discrimination against women. It was the perfect time to talk about equality, to think about a new model, about evolution. And there is no solution, the barbies continue with the model of today\\'s society. So the film doesn\\'t contribute anything, what is the wonderful message, they just show the path of women and turn it around so that in this case it is the man who is discriminated against. If you make a social and political criticism, you have to propose your own solution. In Barbie there is no solution, the solution is the current system.Therefore it is overrated. And on top of not showing the reality of the \"Barbie world\" they show Barbies of all races and sizes, do they sell XXL Barbies? Or Barbies and Ken of all races? They show a diversity that the Barbie universe has never had.',\n",

From the point being that women to this day hold such little power. You can't want to be skinny you need to want to be healthy. You need to show off but not too much. Nothing you'll ever do will be perfect to anyone in power. But along with this it brings up the fact that emotions are something everyone can experience and that it's okay, you can be emotional and logical at the same time. It's okay to not know if what you're doing is right. I won't ever know if I was made to do what I want to do. Am I supposed to be an astronaut? Is that what my purpose is? I feel lazy when I see that everyone is out having amazing times and I'm stuck in the same continuous loop. Literally, everything that can make me me isn't actually me at all and the thought scares me. In our world, we want and fight for power yet nothing ever comes of it.

              "  'Barbie is Gerwig-Lite: just far too self-aware for its own good, to the point where it feels like it was written explicitly to impress critics. Gerwig and Baumbach parrot out every single intersectional feminist talking point in the book in an effort to communicate to the audience, \"Hey, we\\'re aware of the philosophical complexities of this issue but we\\'re still having fun!\" Which, fine, but Gerwig has already probed the question of what it means to be a woman much more meaningfully in her previous films without the kind of extratextual baggage this resorts to; political astuteness doesn\\'t make for very entertaining or memorable film dialogue.Also, I long for the (often hinted-at) version of this movie that critiques the toxicity and shortcomings of corporate feminism instead of basically endorsing it wholeheartedly (although I guess the ending sort of posits it as \"not for everyone\" but again, you see my point as to how overwritten this is). The production design and costumes are colorful and intricate but feel too safe, the soundtrack is rife with bland focus-group pop, and the whole thing has that weird plasticky look and feel to it that all Hollywood movies post-COVID seem to have. (I suppose \"plastic\" is appropriate for a movie about America\\'s favorite doll, but I watched some of The Thin Red Line after getting home from the theater and felt myself ache for a time when humans were able to make beautiful-looking movies). It\\'s indeed as fun and cute and peppy as everyone\\'s said it is, but it could have been so much more.Major points deducted for uncalled-for digs at Pavement and The Godfather (plenty of women love both!!)',\n",

She develops human feelings and tries to come to term with it by meeting her humans whilst forced to string along her Ken. Ken sees the real world, he finds more things that can be of his benefit, MEANWHILE Barbie falls into much deeper bad time. Ruckus happens as the Mattel Company AND Barbie tries to make thing back to what it is used to be AND BECOMES A DASH before things go to late.A very well conceptualized film about Barbie and her plight of finding the meaning of life. I think this is a great idea BUT clearly there are things that can be better.Loved mostly its darker and dramatic moments. Gerwig wrestling the ideas of Barbie both in the Feminist context and the how the public sees it at large was a masterclass. It is where the story really held its landing. YOU could see how Barbie both as an idea and a product, comes to term of how she affected the culture or just how the culture at large move ahead from it. The scene with Ruth and Barbie is so well placed in the script.But for the mixed parts of the film, I felt more mixed with the comedic aspect of the film. The script was fun but verbally the schtick can be quite repetitive. It also was not that witty AND pass quirkiness as such. It was not. Visually, its funnier though but a lot of the jokes can be a hit or miss. I do not think Gerwig understood HOW TO END it with the Ken's BUT practically its her nodding the first wave Feminist, by them maybe trying to get the fundamental rights first before going all out but without any repercussion for the Ken Movement.I also did not like how anti-climactic the Un-Kendollification of the Barbie's was. The grand standing gesture was just repeated too much, that it kinda loses a lot of its power but I guess it was to make sense of the plans for the Ken's afterward.Acting wise definitely, I think Gosling did the best with the comedic material, with Robbie excelling in more dramatic portion of the film. Not as impressed with the others except maybe for McKinnon's weird Barbie and Issa Rae as President Barbie, which both has moments but too small to really be noteworthy.I think it is definitely overhyped AND was meant for children BUT Gerwig did great with all the hoopla she had faced to make this film, especially with its themes of Female Identity AND Barbie herself, the portion of the film I think it had its best success.

While the actors' performances were commendable, the overall message conveyed by the movie was misleading. Instead of celebrating feminine power, it seemed to portray a narrative of feminine revenge and hostility towards men. This approach left little room for nuanced exploration of gender dynamics and empowerment.One of the major shortcomings of the film was its portrayal of male characters. They were depicted as one-dimensional and often treated poorly, almost like brainless toys. This portrayal not only perpetuated stereotypes but also missed an opportunity for a more balanced and thoughtful exploration of gender relationships.Furthermore, the movie's attempts at humor often fell flat. There were very few scenes that genuinely elicited laughter from the audience, leaving the overall tone of the film feeling somewhat dry and uninspired.The most disappointing aspect of Barbie 2023 was its failure to depict women in a more genuine and multifaceted light. Instead, it seemed to promote a stereotypical ideal of perfect, fake, and emotionless women. This portrayal missed the opportunity to showcase the complexities, strengths, and vulnerabilities that real women possess.In conclusion, while Barbie 2023 had the potential to be an adventurous and funny film that celebrated feminine power, it ultimately missed the mark. Its portrayal of gender dynamics and humor left much to be desired, and it seemed to promote a stereotypical image of women that does not reflect the diversity and depth of real women's experiences.\",\n",
              "  \"This is such a unique film! It was so much fun, and had its sweet moments as well! All the choreography was excellently done. The costumes were amazing! I also loved the take Greta had on barbie, and some real problems women and men face. I truly feel like this was such a special movie- and it does not feel like anything I have ever seen before. It was also very funny! (And that's coming from someone who does not like comedy's) I was giggling all the way through the movie. So sad that this gets so much hate, I just feel like it's such a fun movie that everyone should see. So much fun!! Greta Gerwig has done it again!\",\n",
              "  'I have many opinions when it comes to this movie. The movie itself was great, but as everything in life nothing is perfect.Why a 7 out of 10? You may ask yourself, well even though the movie was great produced, had a great casting, great costumes and of course an impressive set, the plot was weak. The fact that Barbie (Margot Robbie) did not last even five minutes in the Real World disappointed me. I know that she was supposed to find Gloria (America Ferrera) to get \"fixed\", so she could go home and be the stereotypical barbie again, which in fact was the main plot of the movie, at first. However, she finds her real fast, not giving Barbie enough time to get to know the Real World, aside from the disrespectful male individuals in the beginning. I would have liked Barbie to experience the Real World in a different way, even though the Real World is messed up. I think it would have been nice for Barbie to eat an ice cream for the first time that was not made of plastic or simply for Ken to feel the water at the beach and realize it was not made of plastic or foam as well.Another thing that I did not like was that some characters from Barbie Dreamhouse were not in the movie, such as Ryan, Raquelle, and Nikki, but it was better like that because we all know Raquelle and her unexplainable need to be more successful than barbie at everything. Although at some points I wonder what would have been like if Raquelle were in the movie and totally interfered with Barbie\\'s plan of getting fixed in the Real World.Let us talk about Ken (Ryan Gosling) for a minute. I must say that, at first, I found Ryan Gosling unfit for the Ken role, but I am completely happy with the way he portrayed his character. He made me laugh so much with his facial expressions and his speeches. I went to watch the movie for Barbie and ended up in love with Ken\\'s character. However, Ken might have been funny, but when he totally invaded Barbie\\'s house and threw her clothes away, I found it mean and disrespectful. Yet we have never thought about the Kens for a second, like where do they go when the Barbies go to sleep.I feel like they took this movie as a huge Mattel propaganda, instead of what it should have been. A fun movie where Barbie ventures into an unknow world for the first time trying to get her \"problems\" fixed but having to bear with Ken throughout the whole trip; like those comedy movies where a duo must stick together through a difficult situation even though they do not entirely love each other\\'s personality.At last, I loved how Barbie did not need a man to be happy or complete and I also loved how Ken realized that he didn\\'t need Barbie for him to be Kenough. Not like in Dreamhouse where Ken is always so clingy and needy of Barbie just because. Like Barbie don\\'t need no man to be Barbie. I also loved Allan and his awkwardness, so sad that they discontinued him and Midge. I would have liked to see Ken and Allan as buddies, after all that\\'s why Allan was created, to be Ken\\'s buddy, although I don\\'t think they would have clicked.Margot did an amazing job as Barbie and so did Ryan as Ken. I love them both and loved their acting in this as well, I truly enjoyed the movie expect the little things mentioned previously.',\n",
              "  \"The only good things about this movie were the actors. Felt like I was watching one big commercial for Barbie constantly plugging outfits and what Barbie really means for young girls, I guess it was produced by Mattel which says a lot.I was hoping for something smart and satirical like the Lego Movie but this was just a silly story with dumb humour.The nostalgia is the draw card for people (including me) I loved Barbie growing up but it wasn't enough for me to enjoy this.Dont waste your time, the producers spent more on the advertising and promo work than they did getting a good story together.\",\n",

Kudos to the creative team behind it, I absolutely adore the set.Greta Gerwig and her team delivered a visual spectacle with a heart.\",\n",
              "  'I saw this movie the other night and had a phenomenal experience. However, I\\'ve needed to sit on it for a little while because there were certain elements that I wasn\\'t sure how to feel about. First, Ken. The character himself was hilarious and Ryan Gosling did an outstanding job doing him justice. I loved how his plot discussed radicalization into patriarchal thinking, (like, the guy just wanted to learn about horses! But pipelines into misogyny are literally everywhere, so Ken, being naive, just falls into it), as well as the societal expectation of *needing* to be in a romantic relationship to a codependent extent, leading into incel ideology.The thing that rubbed me the wrong way was how in the end, after he became his normal self, it felt as if the movie just expected me to be laughing along with him again... like, I still don\\'t wanna be rooting for this guy. Seeing people\\'s response to him as a character after the movie had me confused. I understand, Ryan Gosling is so fine, but Ken is not your babygirl! He still tried to install a patriarchal state and never really apologized!!The plot with the real-world Mattel executives also just felt a little unnecessary to me. It was funny, don\\'t get me wrong, but it just kind of happened and I wasn\\'t sure what to glean from it. At one point I found myself thinking, like, what happened to those guys?? And then they just kinda showed up at the end. I also know it was meant to be commentary on Mattel\\'s predominantly male leadership, but... like, YOU are Mattel. You have a male CEO. Like thanks for addressing it, but you have no room to talk.I think some of the time with this unnecessary plot point could\\'ve been used to touch a bit more on body image issues, because that is a HUGE criticism of the Barbie brand. Like, okay. You had one token fat Barbie with an otherwise entirely straight-sized cast. But some of the jokes were just like \"pregnant people are weird üòÇ\" and they never entirely said \"hey cellulite is not scary its just how it happens\"\\nI think they *tried* to do something about aging being beautiful but it was not really explicit enough to come across. I think it could\\'ve been pretty easy to incorporate a scene, like when Barbie tried tea for the first time, to be like wow! Indulging in pleasures with your food is good and not an indicator of your moral value!Despite my criticisms, I would say this movie is a must-watch. The points it makes are really important. And I actually found the comedy funny instead of cringe, which is rare for me with these types of films!More of a 7.5/10 than a 7, if I had to say.',\n",
              "  \"If Barbie could've done anything with this movie, this is the best it could've done. Pulled off with comedy, heart, and emotion, Barbie delivers.Cast is great. No questions asked. I loved some of the smaller cameos in this film, definitely made the movie more appealing.Humor is back and forth in this movie, and all the jokes will keep you chuckling. I had some people laughing louder than the movie itself to some of these jokes. Props to you, Gerwig.Emotion is heavily involved in the third act of the film, and definitely changes tone. The ending takes sort of a twist, but is a good way to end the film.Overall, the film is great. Highly recommend seeing. Some of the jokes are more adult, so maybe think twice before taking your kid to see this. If you don't have kids, go see this. It'll be worth your money.\",\n",
              "  '\"Barbie\" (2023 release; 114 min) opens with a nice twist/spoof on \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" regarding the arrival of Barbie dolls (as opposed to baby dolls). We then go to \"BarbieLand\" as Barbie wakes up and starts a new and perfect day. Alas, the next day is anything but perfect, and Barbie must go to the real world to fix things...Couple of comments: the long, long awaited real life action film adaptation of \"Barbie\" is finally here, and to be honest I had no idea what to expect. Surely I am not the target audience and I almost certainly would not have bothered to even check this out, except that this is directed (and co-written and co-produced) by Greta Gerwig, for whom I have tremendous respect as a film maker (and not just as an actress). In fact, it turns out that the script, co-written with her real life partner Noan Baumbach) is clever (but not too clever) and socially self-aware (but not too much and hence not preachy). The script is in fact what propels this movie, although of course there are many other aspects which make this film a good movie experience. The cast, led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is top-notch. The production set is great, and the song contributions are tops. In all, \"Barbie\" is an enjoyable movie, in the same way (for me) that \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" was unexpectedly enjoyable.\"Barbie\" has been a critical and commercial smash since its release in theaters earlier this year. It is the top box office movie for 20232 (earning close to $1.5 billion (with a \"b\") worldwide. The movie started showing this weekend on HBO and streaming on Max, where I caught it. If you have been curious but on the fence, I\\'d readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.',\n",

About the humor, it\\'s okay, but at times it can feel a bit fierce out of place, not to call it forced.About its music, the film has several pieces, but they\\'re not able to shine, as well as the movie itself, and just a few like \"What was I made for\", or \"Dance the night away\" are remembered out of all the film has to offer.',\n",

I expected a 3/10 and it was twice as nice, coming in at a solid 6/10.What to like: The sets were a fun mix of real word items and \"Barbified\" backdrops/objects. This quickly normalized the weird blend of a live-action movie based on a toy. The star-studded cast was fantastic! It was fun to watch so many familiar faces in such silly roles.What not to like: The part where Barbie failed was in it\\'s preachiness. I\\'m fine with films having an underlying message- and I even agree with the overall message it seems Barbie was trying to make. America Ferrera\\'s rant towards the end was a bit too heavy/angry for me and made it seem that women had cornered the market on every hardship imaginable.

But through all this Barbie realises she doesn want to go back to being perfect for everyone to project their ideals on her but just live as a regular human. Cute right? Yeah they only problem is NOTHING was convincing. The adventures of our characters were not enough to transform them yet they did change. The only well developed character was KEN. Not only his character arc was amazing compared to the others, it also was a fine commentary of how patriarchy damages young men. So of it was called Ken then I would have rated it like 7, but its a Barbie movie and unfortunately our female lead had the laziest character arc and the most Deus ex machina development ever.Ironically she was through it all really sweet and likeable. Maybe a meta commentary of what women are appreciated for? Sweet and likeable is enough but anything more is too much? And also she only wants to be seen as human?

I found it quite creative to have Barbies living in a land where they thought they had totally solved equal rights, but where in reality they had simply oppressed men.

              "  '\"Thus Spake Zarabarbie\" - that\\'s the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it\\'s origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it\\'s current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that\\'s the philosophy in Margot Robbie\\'s \"Barbieland\". A sterile sort of environment that lives it\\'s life along the lines of a pink \"Groundhog Day\". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned \"Ken\" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a \"Barbie\". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical \"Barbie\" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See \"Weird Barbie\" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn\\'t like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted \"Ken\" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by \"Sasha\" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Ferrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged \"Ken\" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don\\'t have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend \"Sasha\", her much less cyclical mother \"Gloria\" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world\\'s are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman\\'s perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever \"Carla\" from \"Cheers!\") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole \"Barbie\" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end.

              "  '\"I want to do the imagining. I don\\'t want to be the idea.\".When my kid informed me he and his friends were going to see a Barbie movie, I couldn\\'t believe it. The stereotypical mother in me instantly responded. Seeing as how MI and IJ were running in parallel in theatres, I was taken aback and asked him why a group of boys would be interested in seeing Barbie. Will there be any girls there? I\\'m guessing I probably sounded kind of dorky in his ears. His response, though, was typical of his generation:This is a spoof and not a movie aimed at just girls, Mom. But, like any mother, I made arrangements to watch the movie myself before he did. Also, the other reason was that as a kid, I had eight dolls, and the majority of my time went into playing with them and building stories. And only Barbie was one of those dolls whose identity was recognised consistently over the globe. Barbie therefore represents the shared imagination of all kids who play with it across the world.It was the right decision to see this film because otherwise I would not have realised what a brilliant move it was for the brand to reach out to younger consumers. Barbie is a great gimmick for a rebranding campaign to appeal to Generation Z, which places an emphasis on pragmatics.We all know that Barbie has a checkered history. Barbie\\'s version as a math-averse doll was not received well. Barbie, packaged with a \"don\\'t eat\" diet handbook, protested. Someone who seems black on the exterior but is really white on the inside was being mocked by Oreao\\'s crazy cookie Barbie. The creepiest thing was pregnant Barbie with babies in her belly, and the oddest thing was when Barbie went through puberty. Hijab Barbie and Virus Barbie both sparked new debates. Parents were largely concerned about the FBI tip of a security threat regarding the Video Girl Barbie.Most criticised among Gen Z was Barbie\\'s excessively slender body, which has been an undesirable role model for women. It precisely articulates the enormous problem of existential crises that the outside world has manufactured and which individuals have mindlessly embraced.To begin with, the film explored the same themes, including the existential difficulties brought on by the persistence of patriarchy and Barbie stereotypes. The story starts with Barbie living a happy life in Barbieland, but she notices that she is developing human consciousness. To find answers, she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality. As she and Ken enter the real world, Barbie is overwhelmed to see the many ways in which women are treated as objects and devalued. Multiple sets of eyes scrutinise all of their actions. Both Barbie and Ken\\'s masculine awakenings also go through existential crises. Later in the movie, with Ken\\'s changed behaviour after going to the real world, Barbie\\'s attempt to appease Ken\\'s manly ego by playing a weakling is satire. However, the much-touted \"gender war\" is seen humorously despite the fact that it still exists, whether people accept it or not.Now, coming to the technical part of the film, the Barbie-land segment was overdone. The transition from Barbie Land to the actual world was also too long; a crisp cut here, as in Jumanji, would have made more sense. So the movie has a sluggish start, but it picks up speed and becomes engaging as time goes on. The humour was really cliched and cheap, so that wasn\\'t great.Both Margot\\'s and Ryan\\'s performances were excellent. While the actors were all spot-on, the film\\'s direction let it down by not keeping the action moving at a good clip and by delivering a confusing muddle of a plot and a message that left viewers with no clear conclusions. A more succinct conclusion would have been fantastic. Though I did like the part at the end where, at the workplace, Barbie prefers Flat Sandals over heels, I was relating all this to my pageant life, where wearing a minimum of 3.5 inches of heels was mandatory before stepping out of your room in public. In the movie, Barbie leaves the fake world behind.To end with my favourite line by Barbie\\'s creator, Ruth Handler, played by Rhea Perlman: \"Humans have only one ending. Ideas live for ever.\"\\nThe movie is a good introduction to the world of dolls for those who haven\\'t seen anything like it before. It is a case study in itself, showing how the power of sentiment is a driving force in the doll industry. After a year of record sales during the epidemic, last year saw a dip, so it\\'s easy to see why Mattel is counting on the new Barbie film to reverse the trend by syncing up with generation Z\\'s pragmatic thinking.',\n",
              "  '\"Barbie\" is a comedy film based on the line of fashion dolls by Mattel. Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig (\"Lady Bird\", \"Little Women\") and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, it takes every opportunity to revel in its amusing premise with a darkly satirical look at gender structure in society.In Barbieland, a matriarchal utopia where all women are successful, Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives a happy life spending time with her female friends and hanging out with her boyfriend Stereotypical Ken (Ryan Gosling). One night at a dance party, Stereotypical Barbie suddenly finds herself contemplating her own mortality and worries about what her future holds. The next day, Stereotypical Barbie discovers she is now unable to follow her usual routine, which results in her perfect skin breaking out in blemishes. After following advice from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), Stereotypical Barbie travels in her convertible to the real world to meet the child who plays with her, unaware that Stereotypical Ken has stowed away onboard.If you had to name a more iconic doll associated with little girls, I\\'m sure nearly everyone\\'s first pick would be none other than Mattel\\'s Barbie. Since first being launched back in 1959, Barbie has taken the world by storm, with the doll filling many different roles, including but not limited to a doctor, lawyer, astronaut, and even President of the United States. There have also been many movies made that star Barbie in leading roles, all of which have been CGI animated and released exclusively to video and streaming sites. Now adding to that catalogue, Greta Gerwig\\'s live action cinematic feature titled simply \"Barbie\" is not only a fantastic send-up of gender roles but also a great comedy film in its own right that virtually everyone can enjoy regardless of age, gender, or political leaning.What could have been another generic film for parents to put on in the background to keep their young daughters quiet is actually one of the cleverest deconstructions of the world\\'s view of the societal hierarchy since 2014\\'s \"The LEGO Movie\". When we first see Barbieland, it is shown to be a bustling, exuberant paradise that is perfect for all of its inhabitants. That is, of course, only if you are a woman, and not one of the \"Kens\" where their enjoyment is based solely on being an accessory to the other \"Barbies\". It is obvious that this is a place where men cannot make a name for themselves, which sets in motion Stereotypical Ken\\'s desire to travel with Stereotypical Barbie into the real world. Upon arriving, Ken learns that this new place is the mirror opposite of Barbieland, with real life society valuing patriarchy over matriarchy. In any normal instance, I would have rolled my eyes watching a movie allude to contentious political matters like this, but I quickly realised that the film is actually attacking both sides of the spectrum in the best way possible. In Barbieland, the matriarchy causes the women to exude toxic femininity towards men while in the real world we see the patriarchy make men show off their toxic masculinity towards women. Neither of these are glorified and where this film succeeds greatly is in the way it cleverly informs the audience that the extremes on both ends are what causes problems with society and that too much of either always leads to bad results.In addition to satirising gender norms, the film also functions as an amusing, gag-packed standalone comedy for casual viewers as well. There were a number of moments where I found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes being made about the autonomous way Barbieland\\'s populace live their lives. For instance, the Barbies are incapable of touching the ground with flat feet due to their default designs being made for high heel shoes. Also, the Kens are almost always seen at the beach awaiting instructions from the other Barbies, only for most of them to be ignored. However, some of the film\\'s most hilarious parts occur when Barbie and Ken are in the real world, allowing for some humorous fish-out-of-water scenes involving their interactions with real people. There\\'s even the occasional jab taken at Mattel themselves, parodying the commercialism surrounding Barbie and all her accessories. While not every single joke lands, there are so many of them that for every one that fails there are plenty of others that work just fine. In fact, without giving it away, this film has one of the funniest closing lines to a movie I\\'ve ever heard, so much so that it actually caught me off guard during my initial viewing.I also liked the practical production design of this movie, with minimal CG giving Barbieland a real toy-like aesthetic. As one might expect, the most prominently used colour here is pink. Nearly everything important in this world is pink - pink houses, pink beds, pink lamp posts, etc. Believe it or not, there was actually a worldwide shortage of pink paint due to the amount that was used to make this place look as authentically girly as possible. Later when Barbie and Ken are exploring the outside world, things look decidedly ordinary but since they are still wearing their brightly-coloured outfits, the two to stick out like a sore thumb from everybody else. It\\'s rare for a film to effectively use its colour palette to evoke comedy so effectively and this one handles it in a way that all ages will understand it.As a Barbie girl living in her Barbie world, Margot Robbie is clearly having a great time portraying this stereotypical version of the iconic doll. The fact that there\\'s nothing especially noteworthy about this specific Barbie means that she has the most room to grow as a character. Robbie\\'s Barbie is friendly, fun-loving, but blissfully ignorant of what her boyfriend Ken truly wants with her. Though not outright malicious, she inadvertently makes Ken feel unwanted due to her conditioned attitude towards all the other Kens in her world. What I liked best about Robbie\\'s performance was the way she shows an open-mindedness to the character. She is curious about what type of world lies beyond Barbieland and whether things will be the same or different to what she is used to. It would have been easy to have made this Barbie a man-hating blonde bimbo with no capacity for independent thought but rather she remains pleasant towards everyone and is willing to learn about new experiences on her journey.Whether intentional or not, I think Ryan Gosling\\'s version of Ken steals the movie practically every time he is shown on screen. Maybe it\\'s because I\\'m so used to seeing Gosling play stoic, subdued roles but watching him come to life as this version of Barbie\\'s boyfriend was quite a surprise. Although this isn\\'t the first comedic role Gosling has played, it is here that he effectively demonstrates all the humorous possibilities he is capable of as an actor. We watch Ken try to surf at the beach as a means to impress Barbie, only to realise he cannot \"swim\" in the placemat water. Later, he tries to apply for certain jobs in the real world based solely on his gender, but is told that he needs proper qualifications in order to be taken seriously by employers. There\\'s just something about the way Gosling is able to showcase such loveable pathos as Ken that makes you want to see how he can become more than just the generic partner of his more famous girlfriend.From the perspective of a 30-something heterosexual man who has never once expressed interest in playing with dolls, the film \"Barbie\" pulls off the miraculous task of transcending above its stereotypical audience of young girls to appeal to all viewers instead. It offers an observant satire about the world\\'s views on gender roles while also functioning as an amusing comedy film packed with jokes galore. No matter what your general opinion on Barbie may be, whether you love her as an entertaining toy or hate her because you don\\'t care for what she represents, this movie has you covered on both fronts. In that regard, this film has done its job.I rate it a solid 9/10.',\n",
              "  '6.7/10Well, that went as well I imagined it would. There\\'s nothing crazy or fantastical about this movie. I laughed a few times. I tried to go in with an open mind despite the gripes about the film.Firstly, this part is not meant to be deep. Just what I observed on a surface perspective. The message. This is probably the biggest gripe people have had from what I\\'ve seen. It\\'s been done before, and better, only this time Barbie is the face. My conclusion was that both Barbie and need to find who they are in this crazy world. They need to do it in a way that doesn\\'t put the other down, or alienate the other into believing they are or aren\\'t good enough to accomplish something.Margot Robbie continues to be one of my favourite actresses. She did a splendid job as Barbie. Ryan Gosling as Ken is where things got iffy for me. He made it work, but I think his success comes with Simu Liu as his opposite. Without Simu Liu, Gosling (ten years older than me) is just the awkward old guy trying to maintain his youth.Visually the film was great. It felt like a world of make believe, and plastic. The graphics used to create certain scenes worked well, and didn\\'t feel more fake than what they were meant to be. I actually loved the soundtrack for the film. Some really good songs, and while it\\'s put in as a remix, it was nice that \"Barbie Girl\" made the cut. The pacing is steady and the two hours runtime flew by.Overall, an enjoyable and entertaining film. I would say it\\'s worth checking out. Definitely, and obviously, geared towards women more so. Acting, cinematography, and sound are all good. I am convinced however that if Barbie was not the face. This film would not have made $1bn. Cause it\\'s definitely not that good.That\\'s all for now. Thank you for reading my review, and until next time.... Enjoy the show!',\n",
              "  'There are a lot of mixed reviews about this film and I really do not understand the point the people that do not like it are making. Nowadays I feel like we are too insensitive to what actually is happening in the world around us. I\\'ve read reviews stating that this movie is too heavy-handed and trying to be feminist and political. And yet Oppenheimer got more reviews and stars despite it being 100% political. It\\'s like the world is doing exactly what the Barbie movie tells is happening. There is a serious divide in the way people approach feminism and it is honestly really sad that people think that this movie is \"Pitting men against women\" and vice-versa. Although I do not agree with the ending statement of the movie, \"And the Kens one day will achieve as much power in the Barbie land as women hold in the real world\", but in the end Barbie land is really just a reflection of the real world, just opposite, in order to open people\\'s eyes to the fact that yes, women are discriminated against still and that they do not hold much power and autonomy in our world even today.',\n",
              "  'As soon as the first teaser trailer dropped on YouTube for Barbie, it captured my attention and admiration for it recreated the \"Dawn of Men\" sequence from Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey in a very creative and classic way. The hype of that one minute long clip, featuring (my celebrity crush) Margot Robbie who steals the show no matter what movie or role she is in, had me believing that this movie would be phenomenal. And over the course of several months until today, my expectations for this movie got bigger and bigger. This is partly thanks to the Barbenheimer online phenomenon which I followed and watched the both movies on the same opening day.Honestly, I didn\\'t get everything I expected and I cannot say what I got is better than what I had expected. However, 2 hours of my time in front of that huge screen was pretty fun because Barbie is simply a very fun movie to watch and I absolutely loved it. I believe this is thanks to the feeling of watching it on the big screen with a bunch of strangers around to laugh with. I will definitely watch the movie again upon the digital release to try to prove myself wrong.Margot Robbie is, as always, phenomenal in the movie. Her incredible talent and charm carries almost the entire film, not to mention that she is a co-producer. She is not the best casting choice to play a Barbie doll but in this particular Barbie movie, she was born for the role. Her co-star Ryan Gosling is the comedic heart of the movie. Without him, the movie would certainly not be as fun as it is. The rest of the cast also compliment their roles fairly well, playing iconic characters and dolls of different races and sizes.I was expecting a longer, a more serious and elaborate plot for Barbie but what I got instead is not too bad. The movie clearly carries a message and that message is clearly conveyed through a plot that is brief and basically easy to understand which is built up in a favorable way.The production design and the costume design is certainly a huge part of the film. All the costumes, sets, props and everything look and feel so compelling and, most important of all, accurate to the overall history and legacy of Barbie and Mattel. I hugely respect that attention to detail.At the end of the day, Barbie is a movie I have been impatiently waiting for a long time and that I feel honored to have seen today on the opening day. It is a beautiful work of art paying beautiful homage to the legacy of it\\'s origins and I am happy that I started loving this movie way before its release . . .',\n",

But the dwelling on certain ideas and pushing of those ideas was drawn out, laboured.Self-referential, as if they were too scared not to. Imagine a Barbie movie that didn't come with a toxic masculinity lecture? Who would dare make that?A truly bizarre narrative intrusion at one point. Something about Margot Robbie's looks being incompatible with the Barbie character's vulnerable moment? In effect disallowing the Barbie character from having that emotion because the actor playing her is pretty? Very strange.Immature writing in many ways.

Kidding aside, I know that song too and I chose it ... well I would say wisely. Not sure if you think I am hammering anything home here ... I can tell you the movie is! And it did make quite a few people angry - now I understand that one should not count the times you hear the word patriarchy ... won't bode well for you. Also it is quite a lot.But let's get back to the beginning. Why would a grown man even watch a Barbie movie? Well why not? Especially when it begins with one of the best homages to Kubricks 2001 (and Greta has learned quite a bit during her filmmaking career). That said, that completely insane beginning sets a tone - and there is a lot of weird stuff going off here (I think I would be good at beach offs - what do you mean it has nothing to do with the sea and the sand and the ... ohh ... I see)! But that is the point - actually there could have been way more weird stuff - I would have loved it.That said, we do get great actors here - and they all have the same (character) name. Well almost - as easy as it is to remember their names (Ken and Barbie ... sorry Barbie and Ken obviously, lest we forget the star of the movie), is the message of the movie! But and that is what I liked about it more than the almost overbearing message: there is more to discover! You are not or rather you do not have to be what others expect you to be! You are not defined by your significant other (no matter your gender).So while Ken may feel he is nothing without Barbie - well he may go off and do stuff he shouldn't be doing. Like ... (insert a joke about the main point the movie is making and then me explaining something you already know) ... but is it worth it getting hung up on that? Or is it rather better to just enjoy the movie and empower those who never had a voice? Yes a lot of cliches are being thrown around - and the fact many have declared war on ... the movie for no particular reason, makes this even sweeter! They are not even the target audience.There are silly jokes (some aimed at a more grown up audience, like the beach off one), there are references to the doll itself - and there is a lot of comparison. Since this had the green light from Mattel itself it may have to include certain things that are here to shine a good light on them too. Still they don't mind being poked at too (entire board being male for example, a specific doll and much more).Costume and set design is exactly what you would expect - I did not realize the massive budget this had (googled it because a friend mentioned it) .. but it made that money back boxoffice wise and then some.Will Ferrell being the icing on the cake (even if he is unable to catch anything ... even when its right in front of him ... and taking the longest time to get to a beach ... well for obvious timing reasons and very considerate if you think of it) ... a cake that might be pink after all ... hey it once was a color men prefered ... so who knows, things may change one day ... right?

It reads like a piece from epic poetry, as if the gods themselves had come down and made it.

Greta Gerwig took an idea that seemed outdated, like \"Barbie,\" to tell a vivid contemporary story. At the very same time, the film also teases itself and all sorts of pop culture. And all the productions-oh my, they are all very pleasing to my eyes and ears.Some that I\\'m stuck on are the half-jokes/half-seriously tone, which makes the final act not as powerful as it should be.

They also got some laughs over play on words or specific movements made by the actors and actresses because it was just so real and true to the way we all played as children.

The messages however are understandably more female centric but still can be enjoyed and appreciated by all, barring the Mattel Company staff scenes and characters that doest not land. They are portrayed unconvincingly with nonchalant writing and takes you out of the film . The third act feels over-bloated that dips the high trajectory gear that the film was on since the start.

It's all over the place and doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.As a comedy movie it's not very funny, as mentioned I laughed maybe 2 or 3 times but overall it feels more like a drama. The message is deep and not befitting of a comedy film based off of a beloved children's toy. It is also quite long, nearly 2 hours in length, and it is not a very enjoyable experience in my opinion.Maybe I'm just not the target audience for this film, but I can't see too many positives about it.\",\n",
              "  \"This movie is about the best movie you can make with the Barbie franchise. I still found it to be a relatively average movie. I suspect part of that may be that I'm not the originally intended audience, but it may also be that this movie wants to be a thought provoking and social commentary film while handcuffed to the Barbie IP.The casting is fine, Margot Robbie does a good job as Stereotypical Barbie, Ryan Gosling is ok as Sterotypical Ken. Simu Liu is a fun addition as are Kate McKinnon and Michael Cera. I don't know, didn't feel like there were any knockout performances nor any terrible ones.The writing is fine. Again, hands are somewhat tied because the whole movie is a pointed critique on Barbie and Mattel's spotted history as it relates to female empowerment but also capitalist consumerism. And then in the next scene they have some of the sickest product placement for a car in the Chevy Blazer EV. Still, it's a decently funny film with good self-awareness and a script that isn't afraid to take punches (rightfully so) at Mattel. So many punches in fact that I'm surprised Mattel OK'ed the script.Even if I personally didn't get much out of it, I'm sure there's messaging in there that will resonate more to other audiences. I mean there has to be because some of the dialogue is very on the nose. I'm not sure if that's a product of bad writing, constrained runtime, or the very setting of the film, but the sweeping brainwashing and the subsequent deprogramming speech are not very fleshed out; they're pretty generic speeches and not particularly rousing. Normally not a critique I'd levy on a toy movie, but for a movie with a central and visible motif on empowering the every-woman, a tired mother just trying her best, I'd expect something a little more profound.I did quite like the obscure lore that this movie brought to the spotlight. Seems to be a successful strategy pioneered by Disney's Marvel, built on by Sony's Spider-Verse, and now replicated by Mattel's Barbie. What a weird evolution. It's fun though, Alan is great, there's an entire graveyard of discontinued Barbie variants, I wish they had found a way to tie in the Mattel debacle with Computer Scientist Barbie.At just under 2 hours, the movie does feel a little long. I think there are some minor pacing issues but I'm not sure where I would fix what.Overall, it's an OK movie. Pretty much exactly the quality I'd expect out of a Barbie movie but executed in a manner I'd never have predicted. Social commentary that feels strange considering how good this movie has been for the company it criticizes.\",\n",

I understand the filmmakers were attempting to make a statement about women's rights, etc., but it is done is such a heavy handed manner that it comes off as very forced. The costume & production design plus the glitzy choreographed numbers are not enough to make up for the missing substance of Barbie's need to figure out why her life feels wrong. The scene with the ghost felt like something stolen from the Matrix where Neo visits the oracle in the kitchen. This movie was overhyped & got us all to take the bait to see it & it made a billion $.

I won't go deep dive in because my short review doesn't contain any spoilers but trust me, the movie tries to be supportive and share a thoughtful and warm message in a fun way. It isn't woke, it doesn't treat the audience like a dumbass, it doesn't tokenise anybody, it doesn't force anything.

              "  \"Barbie is no longer just a toy; rather, this idea of 'Barbie' has evolved into one of the most famous and significant topics in the world at this moment in time. It is so much more than merely a toy. It will not longer be just 'a toy'I must admit, as i waited in the theatre for the movie to start showing, i had my doubts. So many things scanned through my head: one was that this movie will just be a lighthearted comedy; another was that the marketing for this movie is way too extravagant for a 'comedy'; and one of the biggest was that i would lose interest in this movie soon because i tend to lose track of comedies as it is really difficult for comedy films to impress me. Boy, was I wrong.Where do I start:To start off with, this is NOT just a comedy movie. Would everyone in the theatre have been in tears by the time the movie ended if it had been a simple comedy?This movie is appealing to spectators of varying ages because of its heartwarming plot, a plot that touches everyone's heart, a topic that is heavy in nature but simple in the showcasing of this topic throughout the movie.Barbie focuses on the story of Stereotypical Barbie & Ken... Barbie starts to experience strange thoughts and strange symptoms which causes her to travel to the real world with Ken to find the child who is playing with her doll and to fix the issue. When reading this plot, it is easy to imagine that this is just a comedy, action, simple film etc. However, this is only the PLOT... the storyline is very different.The opening scene itself focuses on a rather heavy topic of childhood, stereotypes, a new generation etc. With Barbie (Margot Robbie) appearing and the one of the little girls smashing her dolls to pieces, this was a very symbolic gesture to add right at the beginning of the film. It is is symbolic in the sense that, the young girl smashing her dolls represents a new generation in which dolls are not played with, it may also represent girls smashing or declining 'their dreams' due to female stereotypes (a topic that is heavy in this film) - I liked that Gerwig made it clear in the first 10 seconds of the movie that this film is not one to be taken lightly.Good comedic scenes are present throughout the film. Such as the jokes about Alan... however, even though Alan being on his own and not many people caring about Alan are seen as 'comedy' - I feel that there is much more behind Alan, and that making his scenes comedic are just a barrier, and that Gerwig wants spectators to take apart these scenes and to analyse what is behind that wall. That being Alan may represent 'women' in the sense that in this male-dominant world, women are constantly feeling pressured and alone, and not listened to.I like how Gerwig didn't make a whole 'new' concept of Barbie... this added to the topic of childhood and simplicity. I particularly liked how when Barbie floats from the top of her dream house to her car, this was symbolic as when young children play with Barbies, that is how they get their Barbie doll down too, they bring the barbie down as if it is floating, I really liked this detail, had innocence to it.Further on in the movie, the topics start to get heavier: For example when Barbie meets Sasha. Sasha described first world problems such as feminism, here Gerwig had SUDDENLY brought in these topics, without warning. Again, I liked this because it shows how suddenly this world makes decisions regarding women's rights, and how quick this world is to judge women.Ken's storyline was also an intricate part of the movie, the 2nd half of the movie is solely based on Ken wanting to not just be Ken and Barbie, but wanting to feel important. In the end, Ken realises that he is important too. Gerwig does this really well.... Although this movie highlights topics relating to women's rights, the end juxtaposes that in a sense and just shows that everyone is equal, and that was a nice message to finish the film off.The ending montage of childhood, barbies, children etc was a really heart-wrenching moment, a great way to end the movie... Gerwig played with emotions here, spectators started off the movie laughing, and ended in crying. Great way to showcase opposing topics.All in all, fantastic movie.\",\n",

The sets are also amazing and the Barbie worlds they created vs. The fake real world sets that they made; really cool.The only part that got old fast was the preachiness of the writing. I got it the first 50 times you made it clear about feminism and that women should run everything and be everything. That is fine, but any filmmaker that keeps repeating their point or theme too much risks boring the audience by overstating or over playing your message. Many mainstream & indies have made this mistake. Really likeable cast and set designs, even the music was funny & clever; so a lot of good overall.',\n",

Production obviously invested a great deal in the set design, barbie dream houses, and wardrobes. It was pink everything with blue \"beach\", with a plastic vibe. It was cool how they incorporated the Barbie box and different outfits, something I loved as a child. I also thought TV Barbie was a blast from the past (90s baby here), and learned about other dolls like Midge, Skipper, and Alan. Also... they didn\\'t do poor Midge any justice. She was played by a terrific actress, so there was definitely a storyline missed with her character. I thought Alan was played very well though.I thought that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling played their characters perfectly, capturing their characters development and different nuances. You could definitely see Barbies transformation into a human, but Margot did a good job at keeping Barbie at her core even in human form.Some of my favorite storylines included the war of the Kens, the discovery of patriarchy, the brainwashing of the Barbies, and the takeover of the Barbies - again.However, the switch to the real world and back felt rushed, as well as the relationship development between Sasha and Gloria, and Barbie. Really what should have happened was a two part movie, to fully tell the story, or a 3 hour movie. I also felt they spent too much time in Barbie world in the beginning and felt myself getting bored.For example, Sasha and Gloria meet Barbie and after one scene believe that she is a doll and follow her back to Barbie world. I felt like Barbie should have had to work to make them believe her, making the discovery of Barbie world by Sasha and Gloria even sweeter, and Barbie\\'s transformation into human even more complex. I wish I got to see her learn more about becoming human. I absolutely loved the gynecologist scene at the end, but felt that could have been earlier in the movie, with the scene with Ruth at the end.I couldn\\'t discern if this movie was just a comedy or trying to be serious, with all the complex nuance surrounding feminism. It could have easily been both if there was more time spent on Barbie\\'s transformation to human. Maybe a second movie could have been about her going back to Barbie world in human form to save her girls and restore the proper control to Barbie.',\n",

Coyote from the old Road Runner animation (1966-73). The opening Barbie Land scenario seems to go on for too long and the intriguing opportunity for Barbie to experience the real world seems too short as well as the divided focus between the real life mother and daughter and their experiences as well as the daughter's feelings which seemed to evolve too suddenly. While the Barbie Land sets are amazingly cute and the acting in Barbie Land had a dazzling sense of toy land fascination, the overall intriguing plot seemed somehow dated and underdeveloped even for young kids today. The movie as a whole had sufficient freshness of style, Margot Robbie's impressive acting, and a dramatic plot sufficient to retain marginal sustained interest to watch the move all the way through to the end to warrant a summer vacation land of entertainment for two hours.\",\n",

Will Ferrells character served no more purpose than advertise the Mattel company as goofy and \"self aware\".

              "  'I\\'m only writing this due to the misperception of this movie. I saw the movie opening night with my GF who loved and still loves Barbie. She is stereotypical Barbie and she dressed up in pink and had a wonderful time. If you\\'re a fan of Barbie you can stop reading here and just go see the movie you will love it.In fact if you are a fan of Barbie I suggest you stop reading this review and allow yourself to enjoy the fantasy and childhood nostalgia the movie will surely provide and avoid discussing the movie with anyone who wants to dissect it or take away from your feel good experience.However, for the people who are championing the movie as a feminist masterpiece or hating on it for its depiction of men, I would like to ask if you watched the same movie? Neither men nor women were the target in this movie. This movie was taking shots at beautiful and desirable people in general. It is established quite early on that the Barbie\\'s and Kens live in a dreamland and falsely believe they have solved the worlds problems and live in blissful ignorance. As soon as this main charachters bliss is threatened, that becomes the problem that the movie focuses on needing to be solved. Even though many real world problems are addressed and pointed out (usually by people not good looking enough to live in barbieland), they are all ignored and left unresolved by the end of the movie, that is, aside from the inclusion of \"ordinary people\" by Mattels introduction of \"Ordinary Barbie\", which seems to serve as further evidence of Mattel claiming self awareness (hammered home by constant self deprecation while never actually crossing the line into actually being the antagonist of the film) and wanting to distance itself from their objectification of women by making Barbie in the first place. Finally Barbie did not get any character growth by becoming real, Mattel just placed her in a box and got her off the production line through manipulative means employed by the founder of Mattel - an old woman. (honestly ladies, this is your real enemy in life lol. Men are pretty useless as depicted, old women who hate you for being young and shitty men who cant have you are the ones who oppress you)The movie however seemed to say these things through mockery:\\n1- if you treat men like the Barbies treat the Kens, you will become one option of many, as made clear by being labelled low commitment casual girlfriends.2 - When your old (like Barbie) you have to leave barbyland and you will be immediately devalued by having to relinquish access to your vagina. HOWEVER even though Ken is old (and unbelievably dumb and useless) he still gets to live in Barby Dreamland and maintains access to all the young beautiful Barby\\'s which just seems to reinforce the supposedly \"patriarchal\" concept of men maintaining value as partners far longer then women.3 - If you\\'re young and pretty (for women) or just pretty (for men), you dont have any real problems and get to focus solely on easing any perceived blows to your extremely fragile emotional state while all the ugly people in the real world maintain order and functionality while dealing with \"real problems\".4 - There in fact is a special existence for people who are good looking enough to qualify and even though its not based in reality, as long as your good enough, you get to live in the perfect dreamland while ugly people live in reality.That being said, the movie is done very well and fun to watch and the casting is done well with all criticisms of the cast being too old, being proven wrong as their age was the actual focal point of the movie. Aside from America Ferrara. We do not like her as an audience lol. Superstore proved this. Her patronizing speech is an insult to women\\'s intellects and the low point of the movie. Gosling\\'s accidently but surprisingly meta self portrayal is probably the highlight.

Very well-written overall.The cinematography is very uqique, one might say characteristic from Gerwig, but it has its own unique weird, twisted style to it.

Plot was a cute but could have been smarter. Its nice to see a new movie that isn't just a remake or a sequel but I fully expect to see a franchise for this.

Ryan Gosling, along side a few other names in the film also deliver solid performances, but none of these can save the film.

The movie lacks the expected nostalgia that a Barbie film should evoke, and it is riddled with hypocrisy and statements that don't hold true within the storyline.At its best, the movie is decent. The acting overral is commendable, especially with Margot Robbie delivering a great performance and being a good fit for her role. Some scenes are enjoyable and endearing, capable of eliciting laughter and providing a good time, but they don't leave a lasting impact. The soundtrack, from my perspective, was consistently great throughout the film with just a couple odd choices.However, my main issue with the movie lies in its overt push of social and political views onto the audience. Instead of letting the viewers interpret the themes on their own, the film explicitly spells out its messages, which can be off-putting. The movie seems too focused on trying to please every audience, resulting in a predictable Hollywood clich√©.Moreover, it appears that the film fails to cater to two significant demographics. Younger viewers might struggle to follow the movie and comprehend its messages, leaving them disconnected and confused. On the other hand, older audiences, who would have been the main target for nostalgic appeal, may find this aspect lacking in the film, missing an opportunity to connect on a deeper level.In summary, while Barbie can be enjoyable when approached with the right mindset and company, the movie falls short of meeting expectations. The strong performances and some fun moments are marred by heavy-handed messaging and a failure to deliver the nostalgia that fans were hoping for.\",\n",

While these concepts are important and relevant, they felt out of place in a Barbie movie. The shift in tone became overwhelming and overshadowed the initial enjoyment.I wanted to love this movie, but the burden of tackling such complex ideas seemed misplaced in the Barbie universe. It lost the essence of what makes a Barbie movie special-simple yet heartwarming stories with valuable life lessons.

While it succeeds in entertaining and snatching a few healthy laughs-with quotes and jokes aimed mostly at an adept audience-it fails in my humble opinion in its underlying intention to convey a moral. The takeaways of the various Barbies, the monologues of the protoganist and her co-star are, in some ways, not only as anachronistic as they are predictable but all in all incomplete in their conclusions.The film flows on the predictable register of a tale that is at once banal and surreal, only to head toward an ultra predictable end without ever, at any time coming across any scene or joke that really captures the viewer's attention.I am not going to go into the various thorny topics addressed by the film because I think they were dealt with superficially while, if there is anything really good to point out, it was certainly the ability to confirm the importance of a serious publicity battage and how decisive the latter is in making all in all mediocre or slightly above sufficiency products achieve results that I sincerely do not think they deserve.\",\n",

The original hopes and dreams of Barbie's existence are brought to life, as she is a doll to inspire girls and young women to be whoever they wish.

It\\'s no easy feat to strike the right balance in a movie like this, but \"Barbie\" managed to do just that.The performances by the actors were commendable. Despite the unconventional nature of portraying a doll on the big screen, all the actors played their parts exceptionally well.

However, \"Barbie\" proved me wrong by exploring meaningful themes and evoking genuine emotions. It touched on friendship, self-discovery, and the importance of staying true to oneself - messages that resonate not only with children but also with adults.In conclusion, \"Barbie\" surpassed my expectations and delivered an enjoyable and heartwarming cinematic experience. It\\'s a movie that manages to entertain with its humor and engaging storytelling, while also providing valuable life lessons.

So if a little girl wants to be a doctor or an astronaut, that\\'s fine (it is), but if she wants to be a mother, it sounds as if it is frowned upon. Tsk tsk.Also, I just can\\'t understand why Barbie and Ken can\\'t be equals. Why do we need one extreme or the other? Why do we need to have COMPETELY Barbie or COMPLETELY Ken? Why can\\'t it be BarKen land? Or KenRie land? You may argue that at the end they somewhat reach equality between Barbie and Ken, but in my opinion, it\\'s not true. Barbies \"allow\" the Kens to also be politicians, but just at a lower ranking. That\\'s equality? I also noticed that once Barbie and Ken first went into the real world, Ken saw that men can also have jobs. From my point of view, he was just very excited that he, a man, could also have a job, but he just became an extreme.Honestly, we have fought for equality, and what is this? Teaching young children that you can only have one or the other, but not a balance? Doesn\\'t this remind you of 60-70 years ago?',\n",

I went to the theater thinking I was going to see an ordinary romantic comedy, but as I watched the movie I started to think about what popular culture has done to people. The costumes are exquisite. The location designs are incredible. Makeup and jewelry design is perfect. And the acting is so natural that it draws you into the movie. A movie for the summer months. You feel incredibly happy when you leave the movie and go home. You are in a fairy tale world but you are facing the harshest realities of the world. I thank everyone who contributed. I hope that the interest in the movie will not lead to a repeat of the mistakes that have been made many times before and a second Barbie movie will not be made.\",\n",
              "  \"Firstly, the marketing for Barbie was great. The cinema was full of people wearing Pink when I watched Barbie on Friday and Oppenheimer on Saturday.Greta Gerwig largely succeeded in creating a fun film that gets her message across although it sometimes became a bit heavy handed at the expense of the narrative and tempo of the Movie.Barbie takes on the noble cause of trying to undo the message portrayed by its early history, reposition the expectations of females (and Barbie dolls) and shine a light on the patriarchy which exists in our society. It's a movie based on a kids toy but aimed at an older demographic who can internalise these messages.The opening act was fantastic. We were introduced to a fantasy Barbie Land which is everything we could have hoped for. The set design in immense and filled with predominantly modern day Barbies living their dream life in Doll houses. Margot Robbie, who plays ''stereotypical Barbie' was made for the roll and Ryan Gosling is great as Ken. The supporting cast are also a lot of fun.In the second act we are given a cause to enter the Real World where we are introduced to Will Ferrall and the Mattel Corporation. They were the least interesting part of the movie. One of the main issue is that they weren't realistic and blurred the lines between the tone of Barbie Land and the real world. Whilst some of their jokes were funny a number of them missed, something that was true of the movie as a whole. We are also introduced to other real world characters who have a bigger role to play.In the third act, things pick up again as we are able to explore Barbie Land. We get an stand-off between competing ideologies which is largely entertaining and funny. In this act there are a number key moments which reinforce the message of the film followed by several resolutions which may or may not please the general audience. There are parts of this act which could have been done better especially when it comes to the overall workings of Barbie Land.Barbie teased being a simple movie about a doll and instead went for the bigger goal of being a strong feminist movie and calling out the patriarchy. Overall there is a lot of fun to be had with the Barbie movie. It aims to deliver a positive message to its core audience however this sometimes comes at the expense of the narrative and tempo of movie as a whole.I never imagined that there would be so many thoughts and discussion to have post a Barbie movie. If you are caught up in The Barbie hype it's worth seeing in the cinema otherwise watch it when it is released to the masses.\",\n",

Basically Live Action Toy Story Barbie.This movie was so much more than expected. It was thought provoking and gave a reflection of our society that women must endure and made way for conversations between mothers and daughters regarding how the world views women vs how they should see themselves. The idealistic Barbie world vs the real world was eye opening to young girls. The Barbie characters were diverse, intelligent and kind. The cameos, easter eggs and acting was fantastic too.Brilliant movie.\",\n",

On the one hand, Barbie amazes with extravagant practical sets and exceptional performances, but on the other hand, the story and directing feel chaotic and erratic. The target audience seems to be moms who played with Barbies and would bring their daughters to the film. Therefore, some film's themes feel more grown up than expected for a movie about a child's toy. Despite probably not being the primary target demographic, I enjoyed the film, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's performance. They elevated the story and script to the successful giant the movie has become. The casting of Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell was perfect for the roles they portrayed. The sets and production design were some of the most impressive I have ever seen in a film! The story was unfocused and unpredictable but also fun and lighthearted. While I wouldn't say Barbie was perfect, and its themes a little too complex for a movie about a toy, its production design and unique story stood out in an era of remakes and sequels.\",\n",

The archetypal Barbie & Ken have fulfilling story arcs. As do the main human characters when Barbie World and the Real World collide. That collision is a big part of making this a fantasy.It looks and sounds great. Its messages are fab. It'll annoy the right people. It's a big-budget Gerwig & Baumbach film. I love their films.

But definitely not a bad one.I'd like to share my perspective on the end part that seems leaving some ppl confused. Even after showing all the difficulties, obstacles, and overcome between the two sexes, the only thing that matters is that we can procreate as humans otherwise all the messages, homages, jokes, history, and thoughts shared in the film will become meaningless without human existence. I don't know much about the director but even if she is a truly thoughtful feminist or not, the challenge of sublimating all the human themes to the simplest message at the ending scene should be evaluated properly.As it went a bit dull and cliche-like throughout the film, It really looked like Barbie(Barbara) was going to have a job interview or something in that scene so was a nice unexpected ending blow to me. Yes, she seemed happy being pregnant(at least she didn't look like she had an STD to me) and it concludes the story neatly.\",\n",

The sets are truly beautiful, actors magnificent, the subject and idea of the story important, its potential endless. Yet so incredibly boring. The first half was not terrible, the second was unbearable. It looked like writers went on strike in the middle of the script. So many good ideas so utterly horribly executed. I think the blame lies with directing and script. I remember imagining several scenes done slightly different for them to be truly funny and so good.\",\n",

But I think it said a lot. It doesn't tell you what to think but it's a reflection of the real world that we live in. I'll probably rewatch it just to hear the dialog properly. And I loved the fashion. It made me feel more confident in being a grown woman and not a baby or a teen. It's kind of grownup outfits yet it doesn't hide the fact that women wants to be pretty amd wear high heels, and that it makes them happy.\",\n",

Having said that, there are still narratives present in the film that are prominent in todays culture. Gender Identity is still a common theme which plays out on a multitude of levels in the film. I am not an academic and probably can't articulate the intellectual philosophies the movie contained.As a woman who played with Barbies as a child, I hold this beloved icon to high esteem. The concept of Barbie seems like a convenient path to drive many of these political narratives in general. Personally, I think it would be even harder to make a regular movie for young girls with Barbie as the main character.Ryan Gosling in an amazing actor. I feel like he stole the show as Ken. I enjoyed the singing and dancing numbers the most. Most of the movie was very heavy handed emotionally. I would have preferred different casting in Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrel's roles. Different actors would have brought a fresher take in general. Margo Robbie was amazing as Barbie. The sets were ok.Overall I would not go out of my way to see the movie again. If RyannGosling does another musical comedy I will definitely see it!\",\n",

Women are portrayed as infinitely oppressed people who can't do anything except for crying about their existence.Don't get me wrong, I expected it to be about feminism and empowerment, but not that awfully straightforward about it.I could've been a great movie. A 10/10 movie, but it feels like the authors just hate men so much, they can't think of anything else.I also feel sorry for all female executives at Mattel. The board of directors is portrayed as oppressively male-only, to maintain the narrative.To sum up, you gonna love it if you want to feel sad and oppressed about being a woman. Not so much if you just like Barbies and want to have a good time.\",\n",

It had an overlong third act with multiple climaxes, that just wouldn\\'t end! Also, the movie had a very conflicting tone: It couldn\\'t decide if the film was a comedy movie, a Bollywood musical, or a message movie! Despite Barbie\\'s overlong running time & inconsistent tone, it was still quite an enjoyable summer movie!Even with warts and all, both actress Margot Robbie and Director Greta Gerwig performed yeoman workmanship on this film. It is a regrettable shame that the Academy Awards people didn\\'t even bother to acknowledge their efforts with any Oscar nominations for them. Thinking ahead for the eventual sequel, Warner Bros.

The world it presents is filled with vibrant colors, whimsical settings, lively music, and a sense of fantasy and extravagance. Visually speaking, the film is truly unmatched. The actors delivered commendable performances, with special applause going to Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. However, I must admit that I personally enjoyed the scenes included in the trailer more than some of the other parts of the film. They struck me as particularly funny.Where the story loses points is in its confusing message. While the film clearly aims to promote gender equality, the way it delivers this message suggests a certain superiority of the female gender. Some of the dialogue felt forced and unrealistic within the narrative. It wasn't so much the fact that the pep talks were about women, but rather the way they were integrated into the story. I want to clarify that my criticisms are not driven by bigotry or sexism. As a woman myself, I appreciate the intention but felt it could have been handled more subtly.I found it disappointing that many of the characters in the film, such as Alan and several of the Barbies/Kens, lacked relevance and development or were straight up stereotypes. Additionally, I would have liked to see more exploration of Barbie Land and its unique characteristics. On a positive note, the message about the transient nature of one's life in comparison to the enduring power of an idea was sweet and exciting.\",\n",

The whole KenLand was pure comedy and imo probably the best part.On the other hand, I also wasn't a fan of how they the BarbieLand was essentially controlled by you know who, but it was exactly the opposite of what happens in real world so yeah if what happens in the real world, being rules by men, is justifiable then yes BarbieLand practices are also right.On a whole a good small giggly movie but not worth a rewatch.\",\n",

It really was very tedious, with same scene content played over and over again.The styling was good as was some of the dance routines and doll movements from the cast but even this got tiresome.The cast tried their best with the material, but to my mind Margot Robbie has done two duff movies in a row, this and Babylon. I am being to think she lacks good judgement and any acting heft.In terms of other reviewers on here, they were watching a different movie and judging the vague thematic material as a plus because it looked out the power dynamic between men and women, forgetting the exploration undertaken in this movie was a historical perspective from the 1960's, when Barbie was invented and really had little application in 2023.In summation it was style over substance, it lacked humour and story and indeed anything memorable.

              "  'First, I\\'d like to clarify one thing: Barbie is not an \"Anti-Men\" or a \"Men-Hating\" Movie in any shape or form. Instead, it is a very thought-provoking exploration of contemporary ideas such as Identity, Self-discovery, Existentialism, Ethics, Feminism, Gender Roles, Consumerism, Materialism, Beauty and Body Image.Barbie feels like a satirical take on the real world, the world we live in.The opening scene of Barbie was very similar to the opening scene of Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey. Then we get introduced to the Barbieland, the most perfect, ideal world according to the Barbies. Everyone\\'s happy, everyone\\'s joyful, and cheerful, and most importantly everything is being run by the Barbies. EVERYTHING. Ken is just a supporting character. There won\\'t be a Ken with Barbie.But then things start to change, Barbie talks about DEATH. Mind you, nobody dies in Barbieland, they get discontinued by MATTEL. Then Barbie embarks on a journey of self-discovery accompanied by Ken.One of my favorite scenes is when Barbie and Ken are in the real world and both of them get catcalled. The stark contrast between the reaction of both Barbie and Ken to the catcalling was portrayed very accurately.Ken learns about Patriarchy in the real world. Ken used to live in a world where everything is run by Barbie but in the real, it\\'s literally the opposite. Ken takes all he has learned in the real world back to Barbieland and changes everything. He literally changes Barbieland to \"Kendom Land\".Meanwhile, Barbie is trying to find answers to why she doesn\\'t feel perfect anymore or why she doesn\\'t feel pretty anymore.We get a glimpse of the Mattel Corporation as well and how literally every working person is like a doll.There is this one monologue in the film which stands out. The monologue which helped Barbie get out of her Existential Crisis.The last 15-20 minutes of the film are perfect, the set designing, the dialogues, everything - it was perfect.If you are someone who loves great films and enjoys great storytelling, you\\'ll love Barbie.Give it a chance and you\\'ll not regret it.',\n",
              "  'Greta Gerwig\\'s latest offering, \"Barbie\", starring the effervescent Margot Robbie and the charismatic Ryan Gosling, had high expectations to meet. The film provides an ample amount of humor and maintains an enjoyable pace. However, it falls short of its potential as a sharp, thought-provoking commentary on our society\\'s obsession with aesthetic perfection and constructed identities.First, let\\'s talk about the performances. Margot Robbie is fantastic in her role as Barbie, breathing life into the plastic figurine with an effortlessly humorous and convincing portrayal. Her comedic timing is impeccable, and her delivery of the lines lands smoothly every time, making for a lot of laughs.Unfortunately, Ryan Gosling\\'s portrayal of Ken didn\\'t manage to hit the same high notes. As a Gosling enthusiast myself, it\\'s disappointing to witness his usually nuanced performance taking a backseat. His portrayal was overdone, his actions and dialogue feeling more like caricature than character. However, considering the history of Gerwig\\'s adept directing, it\\'s plausible to believe the responsibility for this creative choice doesn\\'t lie solely with Gosling.As a social commentary, \"Barbie\" delivers some pointed insights into our societal norms and expectations but, frustratingly, its treatment of these complex themes often feels too overt, which detracts from the potential impact. The film\\'s humor, though consistently amusing, lacks the subtlety that could have transformed it into a more incisive satire.The musical elements of the film were, interestingly, among its strongest aspects. The colorful, campy musical numbers added to the film\\'s eccentricity, and it\\'s a shame these weren\\'t more of a focus. Their quirky charm offered a delightful contrast to the sometimes too-obvious comedy of the rest of the film.While it was an entertaining watch, \"Barbie\" didn\\'t quite meet the high expectations I had for a Gerwig-directed social commentary. However, this may be more a testament to the immense respect I have for her previous work than a damning critique of the film itself. It\\'s still an enjoyable movie, full of laughs and energy, and Margot Robbie\\'s performance alone is worth the price of admission.In conclusion, while \"Barbie\" may not have been as witty or sharp as hoped, it still provides a solidly entertaining viewing experience. Despite its flaws, it\\'s a fun film that will keep you laughing throughout and offer a few insights to chew on.',\n",

The balance between social commentary and comedy was excellent, however. While it occasionally came across heavy handed, that was very much the point and very intentional. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling both do such an amazing job of portraying Barbie and Ken. I will be rewatching to soak everything in for the second time.

Quite honestly, if it wasn\\'t for the pink overload, a good part of the flick was quite entertaining. I thought it a brilliant parody and a shot against crass commercialism, even while engaging in it with all the opening hype in tandem with \"Oppenheimer\" this past summer. Sasha\\'s mom (America Ferrera) had the greatest monolog in the story when she went on about the dichotomy women find themselves in, a no-win situation the way her entire argument was framed. As Stereotypical Barbie, I don\\'t think anyone could argue against the casting of Margot Robbie. I don\\'t know if Ryan Gosling was the best pick to portray Ken, but he did a good job, but I resist thinking that \\'Kendom\\' was some sort of take-off on the word \\'condom\\'. Of course, I could be reading too much into that aspect of the story.

Coming out of the theatre, a whirlwind of emotions flooded my mind. Glorias speech made me realise that even though the world and people demand us to be perfect doesn\\'t mean we have to achieve those demands, we need to find ourselves and love ourselves before we love anyone or let anyone love us. I understand that men feel as though Ken deserved a bit of leadership ad power, but the Barbies built that land. Us woman love this movie because it opens up our imagination of what we can be, and though people says \" Oh, they could\\'ve let the Ken\\'s have a bit of ownership and power\" But when Barbie went to the real world, you could see from most women\\'s perspective of what their life is like on a daily basis \\'not saying all men are like this stereotype\\'.

That was the whole point with the floating and dramatics-things that can only happen in imagination actually happen in the movie.Now, while I enjoyed the movie and didn\\'t see it as preachy at all-in fact, I think it did a great job of saying what Barbie stood for if it wasn\\'t a perfect woman no girl could become-it could\\'ve been better. The plot, while purposely childlike, seemed rushed and half-finished towards the end. Without going to a means of spoiling, I wished for better character development and realism in stead of useless scenes that did nothing but spotlight good looks and physique. This movie COULD\\'VE been a transformational experience along the lines of \"when perfect isn\\'t good enough.\" I really just got a couple rounds of laughs, some nods of approval, and mere silence looking at a movie that even it didn\\'t know where it was going.TL;DR - It\\'s a good movie-not a great movie.',\n",

It also presents Ken the way women have been portrayed in movies since the beginning of the movie industry - clingy, confused, a bit inadequate, annoying, etc.It's smart, it's very funny, it's interesting and it deserves the hype.\",\n",

I even enjoyed the over-the-top portrayal of the patriarchy. It was hilarious. However, I felt the ending fell flat. Maybe they were trying to show how ridiculous the patriarchy was by putting in reverse, but I felt like they acted too dismissive of the plight of the Kens, to the point that it didn't feel satirical but rather like actually not acknowledging them and their voice at all. It felt like in giving women power and a voice they ended up actually mistreating the Kens and laughing it off as funny. Sure, they gave them some minor administrative role at the end, but the attitude when they did it was just so very wrong. Like it ended with the Barbies doing exactly what we complain about men in society doing to women. Not that it happened in the middle as part of their growth. It happened as part of the finale. The final focus of the film. Overall, I highly enjoyed the movie, but the ending really made me leave feeling let down.\",\n",

As a result, we\\'re left with characters flatter than a pancake on a diet.And don\\'t even get me started on the plot. Or should I say, the lack thereof?

You think it's directed at the younger generations but it actually fits since even my own daughter never wanted nor played with a Barbie. I myself had the entire entourage,(and still have them, almost 40 years later) so it was much more endearing and relatable. I liked the underlying themes, which added depth and perspective that I didn't expect at all. I think that taking very complex and deep topics about societal issues and trying to keep them light is quite often better than delving too deep into these topics . It gives people a chance to think, feel and relate to it, without having the movie become too heavy, or being 'too much'. People that thought it was confusing probably didn't understand that the movie intended to keep it lighthearted for this very reason.

Enjoyed it massively up to that point and found it educational without being condisending. As a male especially, to understand the points this film makes it absolutely makes a difference and is eye opening.The cop out and 'realisation' Barbie makes at the very end is frankly a cop out, going against the trend of the entire film.

It does start off cute, but about halfway through the movie it gets very heavy handed with politics, and becomes a complete battle of the sexes. This lasts all the way until the end of the movie. The political messaging starts to become like beating a dead horse by the time the movie is over. What I thought was going to be a fun, relaxing night at the movies turned into what seemed like a political debate. Such a disappointment! I feel like there was so much potential for this to be such a great, fun movie, it really is a shame how it was turned into a battle of the sexes, women are perfect and can do no wrong while men are complete losers showdown. I am a woman myself, and all that political messaging in the movie was so unnecessary. It would have been completely fine to keep the messaging at how girls can grow up to do whatever career they want and they don't have to look a certain way to be beautiful, etc., but this movie was just too over the top with the messaging of women are perfect, women are better than men, etc. It was just all so unnecessary. I did give it a few points because there were a few funny parts in it, and the set was beautiful, but neither of those things could make up for how disappointing it turned out to be.\",\n",
              "  \"Barbie is fantastic from beginning to end. I was hooked in from the beginning of seeing Barbie Land and how it was portrayed. I thought their decision to make it like real dolls from the acting, to the production and set design was perfect, creative, and clever. It was also a little bit unexpected and surprising. Loved all of that. The script is great as a whole as well. Greta and Noah Baumbach wrote, I think a really intriguing story here. Greta's direction is also excellent. Also the cast all nails it here. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling especially. The soundtrack was great as well and fit perfectly. Everything with this I feel just fit pretty seamlessly together and it delivered in the end. What an accomplishment for Greta Gerwig and everyone involved, to make a Barbie movie as great and successful as this.\",\n",
              "  'I\\'m not a fan of modern day musicals. I strongly disliked LaLaLand, could never get through it. Barbie on the other hand I watched all the way through even though I thought it was sugary sweet. Ick. Peer pressure, \"ya gotta see it!\" The last 15 minutes of dialogue in the movie was very good. Actually wish I would have just watched that last 15 minutes rather than the entire movie. The actors/actresses I felt did a good job on their characters. It would have been better, in my opinion, if Barbie was an actual movie without all the plastic sets, the portal from land to sea etc. With all the technology out there surely the sets could have been realistic.',\n",
              "  'I continuously laughed and cried the whole movie. The acting is impeccable. There are so many small details and visual gags that I\\'m sure there were things I missed because I was laughing so much. It\\'s clear the writers are intimately familiar with doll play, and how Barbies are actually used by children.Special shout-out to America Ferrara in this respect. Obviously Robbie and Gosling are amazing, but Ferrera brings the \"human woman\" perspective with enthusiasm and warmth. Her delivery for certain monologues is achingly relatable, and acknowledges issues facing both women and Barbie in a way that validates what women may or may not feel without judgement, just camaraderie.The movie is self aware, the auteur lens making it feel like you\\'re watching alongside someone. I cannot imagine watching the movie and feeling alone- Greta gerwig has brought you into the fold, acknowledging your role as audience but also as witness.This is most apparent in the scenes of the movie that other reviewers have deemed feminist. The whole point of Barbie (the movie and the doll\\'s origins) are to make women feel seen, feel valued and to show that you can be you without collecting things to validate your identity.I absolutely loved every minute of this film and I am so happy that it was made. Thank you to everyone involved in this project, you truly created movie magic.I am unsurprised that there are negative reviews for this movie, as some people do not enjoy looking at the truth head on. Suspend any need for Complacent Barbie, and embrace the wonderful magic of this movie.(barely a spoiler) the second to the last scene of Barbie made me feel the way I did when watching Lovecraft Country, episode 7 (titled \"I am.\") if you need a dose of that energy before you can see the movie again, I absolutely recommend it. No need to watch the whole series if it\\'s not your bag.',\n",

From the wonderful set design and perfect casting to the brilliant soundtrack and story to match, there is something for everyone to enjoy.I can't pay more respect to the cast, Margot Robbie as stereotypical Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken are the obvious standouts, they certainly delivered on the hype - but I was pleasantly surprised by Will Ferrell's short but hilarious moments on screen as well as Michael Cera as Alan (a true unsung hero).As mentioned, the set design is really quite stunning. Gazing upon Barbie land in all it's pink glory is pure joy, there is no doubt the set design is one of the films greatest strengths. But Barbie doesn't just look great, it sounds great with its vibrant collection of tracks and performances (including Ryan Gosling and his guitar).Barbie wraps up all the fun and colour with a solid story and strong positive message that fits perfectly in the world Greta Gerwig created. Of course some people may not enjoy the social commentary that pervades Barbie but I believe Greta Gerwig laid out the foundations for such a message perfectly, empowering girls and boys of all ages.Barbie feels like a must see movie, it built the hype and then delivered exceptionally. If you haven't been tempted yet you're missing out on all the fun that this beautiful movie has to offer.\",\n",
              "  \"I was super excited to see this movie but I'm coming away from the cinema a bit disappointed. The marketing for this was amazing and everyone who watched it said that its not going to be what I expect and so my expectations were very high. There were some clever jokes and very beautiful sets and costumes but honestly the plot was hard to follow and there was nothing very nuanced or clever about the message. I think this film is a little late, maybe it would have resonated better a few years ago when these conversations were first taking place but to me it doesn't add much value to the feminist cause. It's worth seeing as it's definitely of cultural interest, but I won't be rewatching it.\",\n",

And I can't understand how they wouldn't be bored with this film. It's music every couple of mins and everything is way over the top. Actors were great but the script isn't entertaining at all. Honestly the trailer was more fun than the movie. My kids were bored and wanted to leave before the end. But after we made it through the first half of the movie, we might as well suck it up until the end. All in all, an amazing cast and set, but it falls short in actually entertaining the audience.\",\n",
              "  'The whole movie is a gentle punch of love covered in perfect pink. You don\\'t have to be perfect, you are who you are, and your existence itself shall be of intrinsic value.Barbie was created to be a playmate for girls, inspiring them to grow and become outstanding and successful women in all walks of life.But in the real world, Barbie found that she had not fulfilled her mission at all. Her perfect body and appearance caused women body anxiety and appearance anxiety. Served as an accomplice to the objectification of women, she has been sugar-coated by capitalism to be propaganda for consumerism and unrealistic physical ideas, destroyed growth of innate sense of worth and has set the equal rights movement back 50 years.Barbie fell into a deep existential crisis, \"If I can\\'t fulfill my mission, what is the meaning of my existence?\"\\nThe answer given by the director comes from a place of love: \"Your existence itself has intrinsic value, you don\\'t have to earn it, and you have every right to define the meaning of your existence.\"When I looked at the QQ Music Original Soundtrack comment section, I realized that many audience have been moved to tears, so was I especially during below parts:1. A conversation between Barbie and an old woman on a bench at a bus stop.In the world where Barbie lives, there is no aging or death, and everyone is always young and exquisite. When she came to the real world, she met an old lady, and for the first time she looked at this face full of wrinkles, and said sincerely, \" You are beautiful\", which represents her acceptance of aging and the imperfect being of the world, and also represents she has been able to make her own definition of beauty for the very first time ever, and this is the first step for her innate sense of self to emerge.For a long time, in the perfect Barbieland/narratives of consumerism, only perfect and exquisite high heels and clothes, slim and graceful figure and face, decent residence and cars and luxurious parties are beauty. But this time, Barbie defines beauty in a different way by herself.Only when she truly accepts herself, the self who doesn\\'t like high heels, has cellulite on her legs, will age and die, will be confused and sad, can she truly accept the outside world and other people without criticism. And only by true acceptance of the world, other people and herself, one can generate genuine respect. Only then can she look at the old grand lady\\'s hunched back and wrinkled face, and still think it is beautiful.In my opinion, apart from aging, sickness and death, all other worries in life are merely a matter of values, but aging, sickness and death have no solution. Being able to reconcile with aging is not only the calmness of watching one\\'s vitality disappear little by little, but also the courage to face the countdown to death, and the courage to accept this helplessness and cherish every minute of life even more.This reminds me of a related story. Long, long ago, in a faraway land, a king received a prophecy that his son would either become the greatest king ever lived in history or become an unprecedented spiritual leader. The king thought of the thin, poor and sloppy practitioners wandering around he has seen in the past, and was very afraid that his son would abandon the road of ruling and become such, so he built an exquisite, luxurious and enclosed pavilion for him, a walled garden of earthly delights and endless enjoyment. Only the healthy, the young and the happy were allowed inside. Immersed in the pleasures of senses, the prince came of age, protected from the limitations of mortal being and signs of decay and aging. But one day the prince grew curious of outside and wanted to travel outside. So the king ordered all the elderly, sick or dying people to hide at home during the prince\\'s visit. But during his visit outside, God deliberately sent an old man to hobble alongside the road and appeared in the prince\\'s sight. The prince saw an old man for the first time, realized the existence of aging for the first time, and the world and the paradise he once knew collapsed upon him. Then he ran back to his palace with shock and despair. Just like children, when they encountered troubles outside, were bullied, they\\'d run home to let their parents solve the problem, but this time, no one\\'s parents couldn\\'t solve this trouble, not even if his father was the king of the whole universe, he still could not protect his son from the knowledge of mortality. Later, in order to free the world from the suffering of life, aging, sickness and death, the prince resolutely abandoned everything and embarked on the road of no return. After going through all kinds of hardships and dangers, he finally nirvana and became an unprecedented spiritual leader.2. Barbie observed the environment in the park on the bench alone and felt the strong and various emotions of human beings for the first time. The warmth of sunlight, the mottled tree shadows, and the gentle breeze of wind. Barbie shed a tear. Cause before this, she had never felt these emotions, now she has felt what it was like to be alive for the very first time.The human world is not only filles with happiness, but also anxiety, sadness, and helplessness. But it\\'s all those lows that make those happy moments all the more precious.3. Warmth of your gaze:Ken was created as an accessory to Barbie, who would always stand on the beach waiting for Barbie to say hello to him. He has no home, no friends, no job, no ideals, no ego. Ken symbolizes lovestruck girls who lost their sense of self. He projects the ideals and the fantasies of the best qualities a person can have onto a specific person who he does not know yet, making this person an ever-judging God. For him, only when Barbie\\'s eyes are on him, is he happy. Barbie\\'s rejection has validated his miserable existence. But this is not true love. This is why when Barbie said to Ken, \"you must discover who you are without me\", this feels so warm, it\\'s the movie\\'s gentle message to all girls who are deeply troubled by love to find their self again.It\\'s not Barbie and Ken\\nIt\\'s not Ken and Barbie\\nIt\\'s Barbie and it\\'s Ken4. At the end, the conversation between Barbie and the founder Ruth is like a kid and a benevolent old mother. The background music of \"What was I made for\" only made it harder to hold my tears. For those who have been or are looking for the meaning of life, this scene would strike you. \"You created me, don\\'t you control me? Don\\'t I need your permission to be a human?\" If there\\'s higher existence who created us, does he hope to give us complete freedom to choose our beliefs, our values, our actions? And by freedom, I mean, he does not rely on miracles, or bread, or promises of heaven to lure us, to guide us, but to allow us to choose completely freely. And can we afford the heavy burdens of this freedom? So many people couldn\\'t bear it and choose various biased ideologies to get rid of the pain of independent thinking, to get rid of the loneliness of finding meaning in the context of nihilism.In the end, Barbie\\'s ending is also the most inspiring story ending ever, because she didn\\'t choose to stay in Eden-like Barbieland, but chose to become a real human. Seeing that the human world is imperfect, is filled with anxiety and sadness, aging and death, she still chooses this path. Because what she wants is an adventure, so compelling that the pain and suffering of life, as well as the aging and death, would all become worthwhile. Only in this way can she feel her own existence-no longer a manufactured thing, but the creator of her own destiny, the definer of her own meaning.Humans only have one ending, but ideas flew forever.And Barbie has no ending.',\n",
              "  'Greta Gerwig\\'s \"Barbie,\" starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, attempts to reinvent the iconic doll\\'s image by blending comedy, social commentary, and vibrant aesthetics. The film is an ambitious mix of satire and whimsy but falls short of fully delivering on its potential, resulting in an entertaining yet uneven experience.Margot Robbie shines as Barbie, bringing a mix of charm, naivety, and self-awareness to the role. Her performance is both playful and poignant, capturing Barbie\\'s journey from a perfect plastic world to a more complex understanding of reality. Ryan Gosling, as Ken, provides ample comic relief and a surprisingly nuanced take on a character often relegated to the background. The chemistry between Robbie and Gosling is delightful, adding a layer of depth to their otherwise superficial personas.Visually, \"Barbie\" is a treat. The production design is a kaleidoscope of pastel colors and meticulously crafted sets that perfectly capture the fantastical world of Barbie. The costumes are equally impressive, paying homage to various iconic Barbie looks while adding a modern twist. The film\\'s aesthetics are one of its strongest points, creating a captivating and immersive visual experience.Gerwig\\'s direction and screenplay infuse the film with sharp humor and satirical elements, tackling themes of identity, feminism, and consumerism. The film cleverly deconstructs the idealized image of Barbie, questioning societal expectations and gender roles. However, while the film\\'s intentions are commendable, its execution is sometimes muddled. The satirical tone can feel heavy-handed, and the social commentary, although relevant, occasionally lacks subtlety and depth.The film\\'s narrative is another area of inconsistency. The plot follows Barbie as she ventures into the real world, encountering various challenges and revelations. While the premise is intriguing, the storyline often feels disjointed, with abrupt shifts in tone and pacing. Some scenes are overly expository, while others rush through important character developments and plot points, resulting in an uneven storytelling experience.Supporting characters, including those played by America Ferrera and Kate McKinnon, add humor and heart to the film but sometimes feel underutilized. The script juggles multiple themes and subplots, which can lead to a scattered focus and diluted impact.In conclusion, \"Barbie\" is a visually stunning and ambitiously crafted film that offers a fresh and humorous take on a cultural icon. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling\\'s performances, coupled with Gerwig\\'s bold vision, make it an entertaining watch. However, the film\\'s uneven narrative and occasionally heavy-handed social commentary prevent it from fully realizing its potential. For fans of Barbie and those seeking a quirky, satirical adventure, \"Barbie\" provides an enjoyable, if imperfect, cinematic experience.',\n",

Even more so when the trailer released, I loved the 2001 Space Odyssey reference.When it finally came out, and started to hear the reviews, the excitement slowly went away to the point I didn't watch in the theater, but waited to stream it at home.I finally watched it and the critiques were not wrong. It is so incredibly in your face, preachy and just plain unengaging.I didn't care for a single character. It is very obvious what they were going for, with the whole existentialist premise, but the dialogues were as deep and emotional as a tumblr post(When that was a thing)There were very specific parts I enjoyed, but overall, it was not a good or lasting movie experience.The set pieces in Barbieland were gorgeous, the costumes too, and the last scene with Ruth Handler was really nice, loved the light effects and the use of the Billie Eilish song, it would have been a very emotionally powerful scene had there been a better movie before it.However, I appreciate the fact that in the end it doesn't pick a ''side'', but rather gives the message that men and women need each other, and that a matriarchy or a patriarchy is not the ideal world they think it is in the beginning.\",\n",

              "  'I\\'m guinely sad to say this movie fell incredibly flat in my opinion. There was no spark, a film trying to do what it was trying to accomplish needed that spark to make it get it to where it was trying to go! It felt as if it was missing that connection the audience/viewers want to receive and feel from beginning to end, forgetting you\\'re watching a movie, that spark that makes you get lost in the story in a best kind of way. I had beyond high hopes for this film. I was truly ecstatic to see it, and was rooting for it every step of the way... all the way till I stood up from my theater seat as the credits rolled. I had this glooming feeling of confusion(not because I did not get it) and unfulfillment. I literally felt bad for wanting to immediately turn to my sister, whose birthday it was, and ask her what she thought because I knew I\\'d than have to answer that same question to not only her but to everyone else that was going to ask me what I thought. The trailers and hype around it presented it as if it was going to be a hilarious and powerful satire indie film that would go down in cinema history. Yes it had an incredibly outstanding lineup cast, inspiring director and writers, but it was just not all it was hyped up to be. I\\'m definitely in the target audience, so there\\'s no judgment that should be passed on that thought, I just wasn\\'t that captured by it. This is all MY PERSONAL OPINION, but I did not find it funny, I literally caught myself forcing laughter at some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny because I felt bad the jokes were just not landing, and I really did want to like it. It felt alittle all over the place at times, and rushed in multiple scenes that felt there should have been more there. Yes, there was alot of great speeches that were moving, but sometimes it felt like there were so many it took away from others and you got lost in all the underlying meanings. It felt like someone was saying \"look over here, now over here, no back over here!\" The cast was good, visually appealing, and unique, but the movie as a whole just felt lacking. There was substance, but it got lost in all the messages and lessons it wanted us to take from it. Not something I would just put on to watch multiple times. It\\'s a \"once is enough for me\" type of film. I got the message loud and clear, I just felt no connection was able to be made the way the story was told. Maybe if we got to explore the characters more and build that connection to feel one with the film.',\n",

Every scene with Ryan was great, he's got great comedic timing.What didn't work was the real world. The real people are supposed to come and teach the dolls what real life is like, but they do it with the most cliche, cringiest dialogue (I would call it womansplaining honestly, stuff that will make everyone cringe in like 10 years - but hey, it's a Barbie movie in 2023, what can you expect).The issue really is that the real people (the mother and daughter and the Mattel people and even people on the streets) were just not believable as real people. So if you're not going to show believable characters, you may as well just show me the dolls and remove the real world all together.Overall pretty funny, worth a watch, but it has much less depth than I imagined from the trailers. In the end it's just a huge product placement, when it could've been more. But hey, just imagine how them profits will skyrocket.\",\n",

When I saw \"Let me show you\" in the movie theater, all the girls laughed, and this kind of resonance for a long time was very exciting lol.

Well, I am glad I kept an open mind.This is a riotously funny, zany meta comedy with touches of Wes Anderson and Bollywood; yet also strangely affecting. The idea of giving a plastic doll an existential crisis may seem gimmicky, yet it works. The cracks showing in the perfect fa√ßade of the perfect Barbie world are rendered through metaphors that hit the mark, full of a strange melancholia. I am usually put off by sentimentalisms: here, thankfully, they are kept at a bare minimum, even in the ending.Overall, I am astonished this film exists at all. I imagine the authors meeting with a slightly distracted Mattel executive, being given a gazillion of dollars with the vaguest of briefs, and running away with it, to make a film that would send any corporate committee into a tailspin -- I imagine a first projection with the producers fainting and having a heart attack -- yet also make them laugh all the way to the bank.

Holy moly, Barbie hits deep and can be thought provoking, at least to me it was deep and thought provoking. I mean seriously, this isnt a typical fun popcorn movie. Yes it is still fun and pretty damn hilarious at times. But the themes it was showing throughout the story with it being the following - self identity, discovering who you are as a person and want to do in life. It is ok to be imperfect, to be weird, kooky, dark, it's ok to not live up to anyone's expectations in life or those around you. Just be you and only you. Self love. Willing to accept change even if you dont like it. There's also this indepth battle between patriarchy vs matriarchy with some feminism thrown into the mixIt's funny, heartwarming, filled with unexpected surprises and Im sure for all the hardcore Barbie fans who collect the dolls and merch it has all the easter eggs and classic accessible shown through this brilliant movieMargot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did an exceptional job as Barbie and Ken giving us pretty complex and deep characters with them both growing and developing over time.

The movie Barbie (2023) was surprisingly good with it being funny and having a good message; other than the interesting premise to the movie, there is great casting with Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken. Another draw to this movie for me other than the premise and the casting, was the design and the look of the movie looking like a Barbie playset with the look of Barbieland and the amount of pink and the use of life-sized plastic props used like in Barbie toy sets.I could not think of anyone else to play the role of the main Barbie other than Margot Robbie, because she is great in the role with Barbie having an existential crisis about herself, and herself changing like her feet being flat on the ground instead of on tippy toes; she was funny and likable with her trying to find what human is playing with her doll in the real world. Ryan Gosling as Ken was funny to watch being obsessed with the beach, wanting Barbie and him to be more than friends, and discovering things men do in the real world and bringing this stuff to Barbieland; tagging along with Barbie on her journey to the real-world helping Barbie with her problem while also learning new things himself.The rest of the cast of the movie are playing a bunch of diverse kinds of Barbies and Kens involving Weird Barbie played by Kate McKinnon, and there being one Allan played by Michael Cera who is also funny with the rest of the cast that involves how Barbieland works and how their characters interact off each other. The movie has a fictional version of the toy company Mattel with Will Ferrell as the Mattel CEO who is funny, but sometimes some of the scenes at Mattel in the movie were not that funny, even though the way they make fun of Mattel can be funny to watch. There is no real antagonist for this movie, unless you want to count Mattel in the movie, but they are not in the movie as much as they could be, so it focuses on Barbie's self-journey on her existence and how the world works.The world of Barbieland does look amazing with the Barbies having dream houses that look like the toy sets with plastic props and sound effects that makes it look like the Barbies are doing things in their lives, and them occasionally moving around like they are being played with. Everything in Barbieland looks like life sized versions of the toys with water being plastic and the vehicles moving like toy cars, I especially like how Barbieland is connected to the real world as explained by Helen Mirren as the Narrator in the beginning of the movie. Plus, I like how they talk about how the Barbie doll in the real world affects the real Barbies in Barbieland, while also talking about the discontinued/cancelled Barbies and Kens in both worlds.The movie Barbie (2023) was funny, weird, creative, emotionally investing at times, and entertaining/fun to watch; the acting from the whole cast is great, Barbieland looks great, the songs in the movie are catchy, and there is a good message in the movie going around involving Barbie thinking Barbies changed things in the real world with equal rights and stuff like that. An issue would be that it puts its message in your face too much at certain points, but by the second and third act the movie goes a different direction than what I was expecting, and I was laughing a lot. People who love the Barbie toys will like this movie, people who are in the middle with Barbie like me will like it, and the people who do not like the Barbie toys might get some enjoyment out of this film because the movie says both good and not good things about the toys making fun of them which makes this movie entertaining to watch.\",\n",

Margot Robbie is absolute perfection and Michael Cera\\'s \"Allan\" is just hilarious. Not to mention the rest of the cast. It was surprisingly very touching, poignant, and extremely nostalgic. I mean they got everything perfect. Every touch of the playhouses, the outfits. I loved that the entire audience went dressed in pink. The little girl in me was *screaming*. Loved every single part of it. The Kens revolution and dance sequence are just so creative. I would watch this over and over. So thoughtful.',\n",

Music too loud at times too.I do like the message it gets across. It does make me think about the power imbalance of genders and possibly how all genders are oppressed under the patriarchy. It was pretty well done considering how many messages they need to delivers in such a short time. However, I do wish the story was a little bit deeper and that the twists and turns are a little less straight forward. Too much to ask? Maybe.But I like it and feel more empowered after watching.',\n",

I had very high expectations based on how much it's been hyped up, but unfortunately the movie fell flat in my opinion. I think if I had a tween daughter or neice then I would have loved to take her on a night out to see this movie. The Barbie set was nostalgic and so adorable, but the storyline really fell flat for me. I expected a story with a lot of meaning behind it and although some parts were great like when Barbie tells the elderly woman she's beautiful (Ugh! That pulled at my heart strings big time) and the part when America explained the things expected of women as she started de-programming the brainwashed Barbie dolls and lastly when Barbie told Ken it's not his girlfriend or his car that defines him.... those 5 minute scenes were honestly the best things about the movie. I wanted more of those or at least more depth to the storyline. Whether that be more of a connection between Barbie and her human or Barbie spending more time in the real world. I wish there was a better storyline and more feelings throughout the whole movie not just small glimpses.\",\n",

The chemistry between Margot and Ryan is nothing short of spectacular, radiating an irresistible charm that leaps off the screen and captures your heart.Beyond the surface, the film\\'s plot weaves a tapestry of surprises, defying predictability with cunning twists that keep you guessing throughout. Amid the laughter, \"Barbie\" serves as a brilliant mirror, reflecting upon society\\'s norms, dismantling stereotypes, and fearlessly confronting issues of gender inequality and toxic masculinity. Such clever social commentary adds depth and meaning to this seemingly carefree adventure.As for the comedy, prepare for a sidesplitting experience! Joke after joke lands perfectly, leaving you in stitches and gasping for breath. However, the true comedic gem is none other than Will Ferrel, who delivers a performance that leaves a lasting impression. With impeccable timing and wit, he steals the spotlight in every scene, creating comedic gold that will resonate with audiences of all ages.While the movie does wear the hat of a toy advertisement, it walks the tightrope adeptly. Balancing appeal to the younger audience with engaging entertainment for adults, \"Barbie\" strikes a perfect harmony that caters to both ends of the spectrum.With all the praise deservedly sung, there is only one minor drawback - the movie ends too soon!

              "  '\"Barbie\" to me is one of the harder movies to review because I don\\'t know whether I liked it or not. This review will just come from the hip and i\\'m going to list the good and the bad and finally rate it off of what i\\'ve reviewed, so here goes...\"Barbie\" is a comedy/adventure/fantasy about the doll/dolls made by Mattel but with lots of twists on the story. I loved Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie in both their respective roles of Barbie and Ken. Several other character were fun and likeable too, even the small cameo from the man you can\\'t see. The score was fitting, the story was very much fun and entertaining and the \"musical\"? Performances they put on in some scenes were great too, but where I had a problem with the movie was that at times, it just left me empty especially at that ending. Wasn\\'t a big fan of that, could\\'ve been better. And I dislike that they, instead of putting the actual Barbie song in the end credits, they used a rap remix. At times the acting was cheesy but i\\'ll forgive that since the movie was very self-aware. All in all... Think i\\'ll give \"Barbie\" a 7/10. Was good but left more to be desired.',\n",
              "  \"When my wife and daughter are more bored than I am, I know it's not for us. We barely made it through twenty minutes before moving on to something else. Just boring and overhyped. I guess if you're in a certain mood... the only time I laughed was Ken hitting the wave and Barbie with her ridiculously large hairbrush. Beyond that I just found it poor.I would not waste my time. Oppenheimer is much more my speed. The actors are fine performers elsewhere but this was just popcorn silliness and I think it and its marketing took itself way too seriously. For me, it was not worth the wait. Very glad I did not waste money on a theatre.\",\n",
              "  \"This movie was fantastic. Leave it to the writers Greta and Noah to handle the topic of womanhood so well. The details on the set were outstanding. It even addresses some of how Barbie was created. Being on the theater surrounded by women watching this film felt like a significant moment.I will say to all the 1 star reviews and people who brought their 5 year olds to the theater, know your director. This was not a film created to advertise for Barbie, this was thoughtfully created by people who have written indi films and gotten nominated for Oscar's. They know what they want to say and why. The target audience for this film has to be old enough to understand words like Patriarchy which is used a lot in the movie. But don't let this deter you. There's enough music, humor, and and character development for Barbie and Ken to keep the audience entertained even if it's over their head.\",\n",
              "  \"At the interval I was surprised of how much I was enjoying Barbie with its amazing humour which was super ironic and subtle commentary on male patriarchy and consumerism. The overall theme of the movie was also quite good reflecting many aspects of human life and how it becomes more critical with age. But it was so disappointing in the third act which takes away the brilliant build up. Ryan Gosling showed his ranged and made me laugh so many times. Margot Robbie shined brilliantly just like she does during the whole film. But I expected more from Barbie and Greta Gerwig didn't satisfy me. She should have tried for a different sort of ending.\",\n",

The movie did feel a bit long though, a few scenes that felt dragged out. I like the mother and daughter, they were like the audience's soul within the movie.The quote where mothers stand still to show their daughters how far they've gone/made it was really beautiful, my mother cried during that scene.Ryan Gosling shined a lot during this film and I liked that since he represented men. (In a way) opinion.Overall really super enjoyable movie for all ages. More so for the adults in my opinion, great message for the Barbies and the Kens of our real world.\",\n",
              "  'Barbie is a film that on the outside appeals to a younger audience but it is certainly much more mature in overall nature.Barbie pushes the boundaries of what a people blindly may assume a Barbie movie should or would be able to- in both good ways, and bad ways.The good- Barbie is at many moments, fun, adaptive, emotional, even philosophically provoking. The story is enjoyable and attention-grabbing while both Gosling and Robbie have played their roles to a T. Margot Robbie played the \"stereotypical Barbie\" so well, almost too well at times. Ryan Gosling played Ken so well and the contrast between him in two different arcs of the film were not only distinct but all-believable. The costume design was superb and I was thoroughly impressed with some of the visuals and set design throughout. The CGI is very poor at a few scenes (which normally I would put under cons) BUT the film doesn\\'t take its self too seriously during those scenes, so it\\'s rather comical than anything.The bad- The writing of this film contains certain elements of contradiction; It essentially claims that women can (mostly) only be powerful by holding \"high societal job responsibilities,\" such as being a lawyer, doctor, president, etc; when this just simply isn\\'t true, MOTHERS FOR EXAMPLE! Being a mother is one of (if not the biggest) responsibility a human can have- the idea of a collective job that can single handedly shift an entire generations thinking? Yeah, sorry but mother\\'s are the most powerful. The film at several moments gets very political but subliminally and not-subliminally, which is always annoying no matter what political beliefs you carry, it\\'s just almost always cringe I guess?TLDR;\\n\"Barbie\" triumphs in being fun, engaging, and thought-provoking. The film, like many others, sells itself short by its political agenda and removes depth by doing so. Overall a mostly enjoyable experience meant for an adult audience.7.3/10.',\n",
              "  'Greta Gerwig\\'s endlessly entertaining flick isn\\'t the first Barbie movie to be put to screen. However, where other precedents have stopped at princess castles and the magic of women\\'s ballet, her 2023 piece shows every facet of the ubiquitous toy, from her stereotypical \"Barbie World\" to the \"Real World\" implications of Barbie on the feminist and body-positivity movements, and it does so with humor and heartache. This unapologetically-weird-and-all-the-better-for-it film is the cr√®me de la cr√®me of \"franchise\" movies, and has a genuinely moving and empowering message to boot.Margot Robbie does right by Stereotypical Barbie, who lives a perfect \"girl power\" life in the matriarchal Barbie World. However, as her fa√ßade of impeccability begins to crumble, she must traverse the realm between the worlds and find the person playing with her to restore order to her universe. But, she soon discovers, Ken, dying for Barbie to reciprocate his romantic pursuits, stows away on her journey to the Real World, and, after being enlightened on the \"joys\" of patriarchy, resolves to institute it back in Barbie World.This sounds like a ridiculous movie, but fortunately, Gerwig\\'s filmmaking frequency is tuned into this observation, and she plays her silliness cards at every turn, morphing a potential mess of clich√©s and shallowness into a riotous meta dramedy. Even Helen Mirren\\'s small role as the narrator, nostalgically ushering the characters\\' journey forward and poking fun at the poor casting choice of Robbie during a scene where she complains about how hard it is to be her, is impossible to ignore, and so is the delicious plastic dreamscape that is the film\\'s cinematography and scoring (hats off to Dua Lipa). Add in Gerwig\\'s lush, expansive direction to her adroit comedic and dramatic timing and we\\'re delivered with an end result that far exceeds expectations on every level.Of course a film like this will enrage some. A female director and writer? Female actors? Of all backgrounds? A message that says that women should be independent, autonomous, strong people that deserve to be treated with dignity and respect beyond the gendered realm of housewifery? Outrageous! But all kidding aside, I encourage everyone to watch this film in its entirety rather than prejudging it from what certain people have proclaimed are its diabolical goals and understanding that it isn\\'t misandrist (Ken also has a reckoning at the end and accepts his own identity) or political propaganda (since when was female empowerment owned by any single political entity?) but rather a long overdue take on the entanglement of toys like Barbie and feminism, but also how we as a society can improve and make everybody realize that they matter beyond their measurements, possessions, or relationship status.

This review won't dig further into the plot.BAR is a pleasant surprise; it's pretty good fun and the actors, music and scenography all make an exceptional job.The comedy of BAR is self ironic and sarcastic and nails it pretty much spot on. Middle part of the movie gets a bit ordinary and dull but doesn't ruin the film overall.The movies scenes are incredible and really stands out. This also applies to the costumes and soundtrack. Several scenes of this film are brilliantly coordinated and really entertaining.BAR is recommendable for the general movie fan and definitely one to watch.\",\n",
              "  \"It's a Barbie movie. It is as saccharine as Treacle and as empty as Barbie's head. A pink spectacle, and much like the doll, you can try to attach some accessories or throw on a doctor's coat or any array of add-ons you want. However, at the end of the day, it's a cheap children's toy, that any sane adult should ignore or only look upon as some bitter-sweet memento of a childhood that they will never regain.Throughout the build-up to the release of this film, I was led to believe that behind the gloss there was a deeper meaning to it. Greta Gerwig is regarded as an auteur, and the script was said to be too good to pass up. In the end, the message was too shallow to be impactful, the story too 'meta' to be taken seriously, and the dialogue as stiff as the plastic that Barbie is cast from for it to be any good. At least we know who the Real Barbie is for, but when I left the theatre I had no idea who the film is for or what it was really trying to say. It's not exactly a kids' film. It's not an intelligent art house film. It's not a summer action-packed blockbuster, it's not an interesting take on modern-day feminism, nor does it provide any sort of interesting commentary on any social or political issue. It is just a boring pink distraction.\",\n",
              "  \"Greta Gerwig's Barbie explores creation myths in Barbieland, a parallel universe populated by Mattel dolls. The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow.\",\n",
              "  \"What I came away with the most is surprising puzzlement, not so much for the movie's message, but for my inability to account for Margot Robbie's hold on my attention. I can't say this movie impressed me very much, and I doubt many men will enjoy it, but there is time spent with Margot Robbie, who is really unique. I can't really think of another actress who seems to understand the inner workings of a lot more than most of her peers.Her performance pulled me through what seemed a fair description of the problem of patriarchy as seen by women, at least. And an odd depiction of a 'perfect' women's world. I was left thinking Greta Gerwig is almost as unusual as Margot is, but, even so, she seems to not have found an answer to the question she poses in this movie. How do we reconcile the very different world's men and women prefer?It's clever that she uses an iconic doll to make her point, but it's just a way to frame the whole question in a non-threatening way. Still, I can't think of a more entertaining introduction to the issue. And it helps that there are so many great performances in this movie, not to mention the wild sets and energetic production numbers. Not really my thing though I appreciate the skill with which they were rendered.\",\n",

              "  'Opposite of my expectations, overall I thought this movie was entertaining and pretty funny. Ryan Gosling was fantastic as Ken and the Ken\\'s as a whole were really funny and my favorite part about the movie. The set design was knocked out of the park, it was the perfect look of Barbie land and it really immersed you in it. Lastly I thought the little details in the movie were awesome, like as if somebody was playing with Barbie like when she floats down from her house, the shower water is imaginary, and the drink she has at breakfast is imaginary. I love little details like that and Gerwig killed it with those.But just like everyone has been talking about, I\\'d like to talk about the \"message\" this movie is pushing. I overall didn\\'t feel like they were straight \"man hating\", but there definitely were certain parts where you just roll your eyes but it didn\\'t take away from the overall experience for me. The part where they go to the real world and every dude they encounter is a cat calling misogynistic a-hole was a bit much for me, I am obviously aware it happens in the real world but they exaggerated it quite a bit. Imagine you take your young daughter to see this, it\\'s gonna make her think every dude she encounters going forward is an a hole growing up.The Characters of America Ferrera\\'s daughter and the Mattel higher up\\'s were absolutely worthless to the plot. I mean she is introduced to us by honestly being a b**** to Barbie spewing adult themed nonsense and then after that really has no growth and just is along for the \"diversion/twist\" that her mom is the one that needed Barbie\\'s help.My main gripe with this movie is the plot of the last 30 minutes and the ending. Ken comes back from Earth with \"Patriarchal\" ideals and takes over Barbie land and I honestly couldn\\'t tell if they were supposed to be the so on \"villains\" of the movie or if just it was a joking way to have a problem in the movie. Because I never really felt like they were bad guys, Ken was treated like crap by Barbie and so it makes it really hard to ever root against him. The end was just real clunky and stuff just happened so fast and got too serious too fast. It\\'s like they did it just they could get a way to fit in that montage video to pull women\\'s emotional strings.PSA: This is not a kids movie, definitely intended for young adults to middle aged women. Most of the humor in it is adult level humor.But overall I came into this movie thinking I would dread it but came out happy with my experience watching it.',\n",

How can girls compare themselves to a unbendy, out of proportion, busty blonde. And in this case a Barbie without a true purpose. No one wants to be known as stereotypical... Thats just average...The story is fun. Barbie is having an existential crisis while Ken just needs a bit of love.I kept wondering what the *deep dive story* is all about. Is this a person playing with Barbies and Kens and just thinking \"what if\"?The story may be about nothing important. Or it might showcase the strugles of the real world.Do girls still play with Barbie and does Ken even feature??The soundtrack is good.And i LOVE Weird Barbie but i dont think my Barbie would have made it in the movie, she was attacked by hooligans with toothpick spikes and she lost her head when the tried fitting her into King Solomons Mines (do you remember the) stewpot.....

Movie\" and this is why the negative reviewers are getting crapped on because our reviews are our opinion that they don\\'t like.',\n",
              "  'The title by no means suggests that this movie was predictable. Greta Gerwig does a wonderful job making the 1 hour and 54 minutes enjoyable for a wide range of audiences (which was originally a worry of mine, as a movie centered around the Barbie doll franchise seemed a narrow area of public interest). Rather, following countless pre-release trailers, interviews, promotions, and marketing schemes, I had a general idea of what the movie could be about. In other words, I was not left surprised or awed by new and unexpected artistic choices.The movie I expected was a comedic, lighthearted adventure surrounding Barbie and her \"universe\" of Barbies and Kens (and Allan), a pink and perfect world of constant happiness and beauty, until something goes terribly wrong: Barbie starts becoming human. What would follow is a wacky adventure wherein Barbie would seek for a solution to her problem, and in doing so, finding what it means to be human; furthermore, what it means to be a woman in a \"world of men.\"And this is more or less the framework of Gerwig\\'s film. Of course, there are many other creative aspects that were not anticipated, and the way it built off of a beloved franchise was admirable, to say the least, and clever. Though I was not a big Barbie fan as a child, there were all kinds of Easter eggs referencing Barbie lore throughout the movie. Many would say this film did Barbie and her fans justice.Overall, I expected the film to be good. And that is what I thought of it: it was an enjoyable and entertaining movie, though would not be on a list of favorites.It didn\\'t move me in the way I believed it intended to. Some moments were emotional, but it did not leave me with profound thoughts on the state of modern-day patriarchy, or the hardened corporate heart of society. Perhaps this was because it was very well cushioned by comedic dialogue and colorful, fun design, successfully softening the blow of the movie\\'s larger themes.I also agree that it was quite preachy, and although there was power behind the speeches about the feminist struggle and the expectations of perfections in an imperfect world, it felt very heavy-handed (especially towards the end of the film).Despite how I feel about Barbie not living up to its full potential, I encourage everyone to watch it. Not just because my opinion really doesn\\'t mean anything among the experiences of others, but because it deserves a chance at changing another person\\'s mind.I fully support how Barbie encourages the breaking of gender norms and awareness and transparency about mental health. The arc Barbie follows is touching, brave, and familiar to all those experiencing the ups and downs of life\\'s many paths. Ultimately, it is worth a watch, and certainly opens new doors for future filmmaking and marketing.',\n",
              "  'The Barbie movie had a very easy going start with parties, colors, and making fun of stereotypes. It\\'s all very musical-like untill Barbie asks the question about dying which can be seen in trailer.The movie slowly starts to take itself more seriously and when Barbie goes to the \"Real World\" she faces problems that modern woman has. Ken also has to face the \"Real World\" but does it in his own way. It was very cool seeing two characters detached from reality and having completely different view on the world face the \"reality\" and carry themselves with it. It makes the characters more fleshed out which the movie does well, as i\\'ve got a feeling that Barbie and Ken in particular are behaving just how they were imagined to since they were first made.Time and Change are factors that are actually displayed through small cameos and at the ending itself, but have a very important meaning and are factors that should be thought about after you watch the movie.Ultimately, the \"agenda\" goes from funny jokes to actual rants towards the end of the movie but it all comes a full circle and sends a strong message.The music and cinematography are very cartoonish and nice, so is the dialogue. The references to other media are very cleverly put throughout the movie as well. The dialogue at the beginning is made to look like kids actually playing with those dolls but facing the reality is actually a very good space for character development, and Barbie used that very good. Even tho some \"agendas\" are pushed throughout the movie, it ultimately sends a good message, and does what Barbie is supposed to do : to inspire girls and make them feel strong for who they are.',\n",
              "  'Well, here\\'s the next movie I watched in preparation for the Oscars, and I can see why it got nominated in multiple categories. What a surprise...it sure wasn\\'t what I was expecting!I\\'m going to preface this review by saying that I am a woman who had some Barbie dolls as a kid, but was never terribly fond of them (more of a horse and dinosaur girl, myself). So I wasn\\'t really interested in this movie at first, until the Oscar nominations came along. But, I am glad I gave it a chance and saw it, as it was more meaningful and mature than I expected. It was not totally inappropriate for kids...but I didn\\'t really get the sense it was a kids\\' film, despite being about a universe of toys.But, onto to the real review now...First off: The setting of Barbieland itself was well-done! It felt like those hot-pink plastic playsets had really come to life, and it was clever how the physics in that world imitated playtime (for instance, how there was no actual liquid in the cups Barbie drank out of).Next: the acting! Most of the cast did a pretty stellar job here. I thought Will Ferrell\\'s role as the Mattel CEO was quirky and seemed a bit odd to me though, almost as if he was channeling too much energy from Buddy in \"Elf.\" But the other characters did really hit home with the emotions they were trying to convey. The comedy was usually pretty spot-on too, and I did find myself laughing quite a lot throughout the film!Also, the music! \"I\\'m Just Ken\" was an unexpectedly fun jam with an 80s flair, \"What Was I Made For\" was certainly worthy of the attention it has gotten, and \"Dance the Night Away\" is also a pretty fun song, well-suited to a Barbie dance party.So, those things all worked well for me. Where the movie started to fall short was its plotlines and messaging.The basic premise was a fairly solid one...show stereotypical Barbie in her perfect dreamhouse world, but then explore what happens when the imperfections of the real world start to trickle in.The movie seemed kind of conflicted about how to build upon this idea, though. Barbie started to become \"imperfect\" because of America Ferrera\\'s character playing with her, and transferring some of her own insecurities into the doll. But we never really ended up seeing that plotline developed as clearly as we could have. I would have liked to learn more about this character\\'s backstory, as well as how her relationship with her daughter has become damaged.But, then we also discover that Kens are not satisfied with their role in Barbie life, and when they discover how prominent men are in the Real World, this inspires them to form a patriarchy and take over Barbieland. So now we have this plotline running along too, in addition to the underdeveloped one about the connection between a doll and the human playing with it.And on top of that, we have a plotline about the head honchos at Mattel trying to capture Barbie in the Real World and subdue her, returning her to her box (which would do...what, exactly? Would this restore her to the way she used to be?). But then they realize she has gone back to Barbieland with some humans, and they follow them there, only to skulk around and not really accomplish much at all besides some brief commentary near the end of the film.So I feel like the plot was quite a bit more scattered than it could have been. The messaging was also a little heavy-handed, as others have said. And, I wasn\\'t completely satisfied with how things turned out for the Kens....Yeah, I am a woman, and women\\'s rights are important, but this doesn\\'t mean I want to see women rule the world and men put in the shadows. Both in the real world and in a child\\'s playland, I want to see people of all genders be able to dream and to accomplish those dreams...to stand by each other\\'s side rather than in anyone\\'s shadow. The messages that Barbie doesn\\'t have to be perfect to be her amazing self, and that Ken is not \"just Ken\" and has his own individual importance too, are great ones, but they get a little lost in the static of over-explanation here.All in all, I feel like this movie could have used some tweaking and streamlining to make its plot feel more complete and effective, but it was still a worthwhile experience, and better than I expected as someone who\\'s never really been a Barbie fan. I can see this winning some Academy Awards, but probably not Best Picture.',\n",
              "  'Barbie, the iconic doll that has been a beloved part of countless childhoods for generations, has finally made her way to the big screen in the 2023 movie adaptation aptly titled \"Barbie.\"On the flip side, the film\\'s attempts at humor often fell flat. The jokes and gags felt forced, and some of the comedic moments were cringe-worthy. It seemed as though the filmmakers were trying too hard to make Barbie relevant to a modern audience, resulting in a lack of authenticity in the humor.Barbie left me somewhat disappointed. While it showcased catchy songs, the storyline felt clich√©d, lacking depth. Margot Robbie\\'s work for Barbie was commendable, but the overall plot failed to engage adults. It\\'s a decent choice for kids, but falls short of the mark for a broader audience. 5/10.',\n",
              "  \"This movie caught me by surprise! It was a lot more satisfying, wholesome and funnier than I honestly expected. There's a genuine, happy magic to this movie and it's clearly reflected and projected by the entire cast. It went hand-in-hand with the constructive criticism regarding female and male stereotypes.The diverse cast was star-studded and each actor brought their A-game to the set. Their enthusiasm was irresistible and it made every song and dance number stand out on its own.Mega kudos to Greta Gerwig for cleverly bringing us this delightful gem that's a truly fresh take compared to a majority of the rehashed stuff we see on the big screen these days.\",\n",
              "  \"I expected waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more. Like, it was so popular and rated high, so my expectations were high. After watching the film, I was not impressed enough. I was not disappointed, the film is good. But it is not excellent. I like some parts, and some parts were okay. I especially did not like the ending much. I was thinking it was for women, like some type of motivational. In fact, the main idea (as I understood) was from motivational. I liked the idea of togetherness, and the impact women can have in society. I like it, but not loved it. It's fun, but not fun enough for your stomach to start hurting from laughing.\",\n",
              "  'I think this film describes an important message that everything in this world won\\'t be perfect. Our ideas and thoughts will always be in this planet and we can\\'t let ourselves down because we are not the perfect person. We need to learn with our choices and our mistakes, but in the end, we can improve as a person. Even when you feel lost, you need ton keep your head high and when you least except it, you will understand why \"YOU\" are in this world, finding your purpose, leaving your beautiful thoughts and ideas to others.In general, the movie is funny with a great cast and an incredible production.',\n",
              "  'The real power of cinema came to the forefront as two films went head to head against one another this Friday. One was based on a childhood icon that attained the status of a cultural phenomenon over the years as evident from the massive craze around it and the other was based on an icon in the realm of science whose invention changed the course of the world and was directed by a man who has emerged as a phenomena himself in the world of cinema. The former celebrates girl power and inclusivity while the latter is largely a man\\'s world built on a critique of warfare and corrupt politics. To address the elephant in the room, \"Oppenheimer\" beats \"Barbie\" on all fronts without having to put up much of a fight, irrespective of what the box office figures might denote.That said, \"Barbie\" is a good film, a fun watch, that could have been so much more. The first half was a joyride providing all the fun that the film must have intended to provide during the course of its runtime. It was a job well done by the art directors and set designers as they enabled in creating a vibrant, colourful world without any trace of morbidity. The Barbie houses, the beach, the house of the Weird Barbie, the roads, the Netherlands-like fields, the sea - they were created with a perfection that one can only dream of, only to let you sink and immerse yourselves in the colours that Gerwig\\'s vision could have borrowed straight of the rainbow. To conceptualize and execute such a world is an extraordinary accomplishment with the sets perfectly complementing the colourful lives of our Barbies. The Barbies come from all walks of life, hold important positions, and stay at the frontline of Barbie life - a contrast to the human world where a bigshot at a top private firm claims to Ken that they don the mask of inclusivity so that they do not have to deal with a backlash. At the center of all these Barbies is Margot Robbie\\'s Stereotypical Barbie who is ever joyful and unfettered by emotions like grief or anxiety. She is the paragon of the beauty as it was once envisioned, hence the stereotype about her. The Kens have nothing much to do in this world other than bicker over their vulnerabilities. All was well until the real world began messing with the Barbie world and our protagonist is hit by concerning thoughts like death. Depression takes root in her mind and she has to embark on a journey to the real world to not only fix her own life but also that of her owner. \"Barbie\" should have stopped here or should have taken an alternate route to the denouement as the second half just steers out of control and every theme seemed to being heavily hammered into youe mind as if the script had lost confidence in the viewer to effortlessly let those ideas in. The last 30 minutes felt stretched out of control except for the incredibly done Ken song - one of my favourite moments from the film. Gerwig had let the viewers have most of the fun in the first hour but the script lost the steam as it trudged to the finish line. Gerwig is worthy appreciation for her vision, for the world she has accomplished in this film, for the infinite ideas she has established - feminism to motherhood to inclusivity to bending all gender stereotypes. She has been sensitive and empathetic in her handling of depression. If only she had not taken the approach of a moral parable in the second half this film could have been so much better.\"Barbie\" packs in a stellar cast with every single one of them investing the best of their qualities in the project. Robbie looks absolutely pretty as she should have in this role and handles joy, sadness, existential crisis with the capability that she as an actor has always possessed. Issa Rae as President Barbie and Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie are two other standouts. But the real star of the show is Ryan Gosling - his Ken-ergy is infectious and will keep you in splits throughout. Just look at his incredible comedic chops when Ken visits the human world. You just can\\'t have Ken-ough of Gosling\\'s Ken. \"La La Land\" showed that he could dance really well, a skill he has put effectively to use in the Ken song too.In the end, Gerwig\\'s film is a pretty looking tribute to a pretty cultural phenomena. It could have had a little more of the \"muchness\" (as the Mad Hatter would say in \"Alice in Wonderland\") in the fun department. It dazzles throughout but the baggage of its heavy-handedness drags it down to an extent. Alas!',\n",
              "  \"This film had to be more than advertising Mattel's famous doll, which set the standard for playthings fifty-odd years ago. And getting Greta Gerwig to direct a movie about Barbie, seems to have been a creative masterstroke. As expected, she has delivered a stylish incarnation of the sometimes much-derided doll, and it's a fun movie that carries its serious message quite lightly.It looks spectacular, with Barbieland depicted with so much pink it could be nauseating, but the camera is moved around very skilfully so that images are fleeting. With most of the characters being Ken or Barbie, it is easy to follow, and the audience knows that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are the pair to follow.The plot is simple enough, with Barbie suffering a trauma that causes her to visit the real world where some shattering illusions cause her to rethink her role as a female icon. Robbie is stunning in this role, she has always shone in playing over the top characters, and Barbie has given her plenty of scope for this. She is matched by a superb Ryan Gosling, clearly enjoying playing a downtrodden male who gets a chance to avenge his status, and the rest of the cast are all good as well, particularly America Ferrera as a Mattel employee who sees through the Barbie dream, and Will Ferrell, being the usual Will Ferrell as the boss of Mattel.I really enjoyed the film, but the second part was somewhat overlong. Gerwig also couldn't resist getting into a preachy mode as the ending approached. I docked two stars for that, but otherwise this film was the tonic the film industry needed. There have been too many mediocre films lately, this isn't one of them.\",\n",
              "  \"Barbie opens with an homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey before quickly transitioning to the visually stunning, artificial reality of Barbieland, where the sky is a painting and the food imagined. It's colorful, the set designers display fully realized artistic visions-it's nice to see a movie that isn't over sanitized for a mass audience, a movie that doesn't play it safe. You can see the influences Greta Gerwig wanted to include from old Hollywood all over the place. Margot Robbie is the star as Barbie, fully embodying the perfect Barbie life until cracks start to form in Barbieland.Barbie presents two dystopian worlds, one a bad version of the real world, and Barbieland, where men are pushed aside and given nothing to do at all. Ken discovers the idea of the patriarchy after being respected for the first time in his life in the real world because he never had any power. It was a desperate attempt to gain equality from a member of the oppressed class. Ken is essential to the emotional core of the film. He's how we see the injustice of Barbieland. The movie isn't man-hating, it uses the poor treatment of the Kens by the Barbies to say how dumb discrimination is and that we should all treat each other as individuals, capable of working within our individual talents and skills and that we should be authentic to who we are.** Significant spoilers after this point**The movie also tells us through a memorable monologue from Gloria (thanks to America Ferrera's excellent performance) that we don't have to be perfect, we can embrace being ordinary. She doesn't want the perfect Barbie life either, she wants an ordinary Barbie that's also a mom, loves her family, and embraces her imperfections as good things. The concern with insecurity caused by Barbie is made less tactfully by Gloria's daughter who goes on a screed calling Barbie a fascist (you can't tell me this was intended to be self serious and not a way to poke fun at Gen Z self righteousness).Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie also learns these values, shown when she is sitting at the bus stop in the real world and looks over at the older woman next to her and tells her she is beautiful. Barbie sees beyond the plastic perfection of Barbieland. This is why it's so important she leaves Barbieland at the end of the film, she rejects the reimposed female domination of Barbieland and the point of the film is to say the real world is better than what women may imagine happens in Barbieland. Barbieland is not the good place.There were some significant negatives for me though. I thought the movie had some humor that fell very flat in parts. The scenes at Mattel didn't do much for me. The movie was at its weakest in the real world (where we spent a lot of time). Some of the characters had rushed development.I am Kenough.\",\n",
              "  \"Finally got around to viewing this, and it was really great fun. A solid story. It's Aldus Huxley's 'Brave New World' and Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', done with lots of pink and lots of music and dancing, far more than I expected.Margo Robbie pretty much owns this movie, and rightly so. She and Ryan Gosling take over the screen and must of had a load of fun.The set design is very inventive and is very pivotal to the films plot. Never seen so many high heels in a mainstream movie. So many great costumes that help along with the pop background.Really silly and funny look at life, very metaphoric, plenty of fun here, the screening was full, just 6 seats left.\",\n",

I can see where people are coming from with all the negativity but I personally did not mind it! The camerawork was pretty good, the acting was good though it can get cheesy at certain times, the story wasn't bad but it wasn't perfect or amazing. But the best thing about the movie is how fun it is, you can sit down after school, work, stressful or busy day and you just lay back and have a good time! I do recommend it to people who want a fun experience. Although if your looking for a serious, action filled, 10 star movie, this is probably not for you.\",\n",

I only saw 1 or two trailers for this movie, and it just looked like a fun movie about barbie in Barbieland and she for some reason goes into the real world. The sub plot of needing to help the girl that is playing with here is just that sub plot the main plot ends up being patriarchy and matriarchy. The sub plot should have been the main plot. The set design was great, the world looked beautiful, the story just sucked. Not all men are pigs or stupid in the real world and I thought they leaned way to hard into this. If they were going to go with this main plot of who is the top dog it should have ended with mainly barbies and 1 ken on council at the very least. I grew up playing with Barbies and I am sorry, but my Barbies always loved their kens. For Barbie to basically hate her ken was just a slap in the face in my opinion. There was not enough Barbieland and too much stupidity.',\n",

And the other thing I love about this is that because the movie is a goofy comedy, you don't have to take the everything too seriously and you just go with it, and you enjoy the comedic ride all the way through the movie.On the other hand, the movie also provides a lot of criticism towards the many flaws in our society and all through the movie you find things, that reflect that, and I believe they are portrayed perfectly.Without spoiling to much I would recommend the movie to anyone as on the one hand I think it produces a lot of important messages and on the other I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy the comedic experience.\",\n",

However, for the main character of the show it did not seem that way - Ken took most of the limelight. Rightfully so with Ryan playing a stellar part.The story starts off light hearted and fun but takes a dive with preaching against the patriarchy. While granted in this day and age, there's a limit to the level of guff one can take.A colourful and fun movie that always tries to be more than it can be. Probably not a good idea to bring young kids as the premise and message will go over their heads.\",\n",

              "  'Barbie is a vibrant and subversive film brought to life by Greta Gerwig with infectiously chaotic energy. The production design is exquisite and the cast is absolutely stacked with great actors and great performances.Margot Robbie is magnificent and Ryan Gosling absolutely knocks it out of the park.Gerwig and Baumbach have created a thematically rich satire that manages to be heavy-handed in its messaging, while sometimes feeling a tad bit too preachy it mostly satisfies. By taking an iconic IP like Barbie in such an unexpected and mature direction, this film is able to instantly crown itself a classic. In an era where Hollywood loved to play it safe, Barbie\\'s boldness reminds us of the power of doing things differently and taking big swings. The film is little over-the-top at times, but it never stops being pure cinematic fun. In the second act the film looses itself a bit, which I think is due Gerwig wanting to make to many statements at once. But the third act puts the focus back on the central aspects and pulls some existencial strings. Gerwig manages to give a beautiful closure to the story while at the same time leave the audience with an uplifting message for BOTH genders.As a man, I get why some would feel discomfort watching this movie, thats okay, but giving it a one star rating for that is absolutely ridiculous. This is a great crafted piece of cinema and no less. Greta Gerwig didn\\'t intend to give a balanced perspective of men versus women with Barbie. She made a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men.I love blockbusters that aren\\'t afraid to take risks and Barbie is one of the most risky blockbusters in recent memory - and one that absolutely succeeds.',\n",

He's a later day Jack Lemmon. I can't wait to see what he does next.I love that it's a fun movie with deeper meaning. It's not strictly about women but it focuses on the impossible expectations placed on women.Ken represents what women often have be relegated to and searching for his own identity.Kate McKinnon's Barbie represents what women face when everyone decides they don't measure up but who do they all turn to to fix things? .\\nAllan is the overlooked one which many can identify with. Finally America's speech captures the frustrations.Highly enjoyable and emotional at the same time.\",\n",

But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are \"brainwashed\" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.\n",

            "Rese√±a 2: Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\n",

            "Rese√±a 3: I do not usually write reviews, but this is beyond description. Last time I wrote a review it was for the absolutely horrible wrinkle in time. This is almost as bad. At least Gosling plays his part well, but the story is abysmal. If you can find anything else to do like watch paint dry, then yes please do. You will save your brain cells the agony of a painful slow ..... nearly two hours long this was mind-numbing storytelling at its mediocre worst. How many ways can I say do not go see it if you have a choice. See anything else but this exercise in horrendous cliches and exaggerated self-importance. If I could give it negative 10 stars I would.\n",

            "Rese√±a 4: As much as it pains me to give a movie called \"Barbie\" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.\n",

            "Rese√±a 5: I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism & how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.( SPOILERS AHEAD )Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..\n",

            "Rese√±a 6: I thought this would be so much different. The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men. Which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people.\n",

            "Rese√±a 7: Before making Barbie (2023),Greta Gerwigsingle-handedly directed two films:Lady Bird (2017)andLittle Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played byMargot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows isThe Wizard of Oz (1939)journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way ofThe Truman Show (1998)orStranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.\n",

            "Rese√±a 8: Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again.\n",

            "Rese√±a 9: The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.\n",

            "Rese√±a 10: I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term \"Marvel speak.\" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: \"You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!\"The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.\n",

            "Rese√±a 11: It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.8/10.\n",

            "Rese√±a 12: My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction.\n",

            "Rese√±a 13: It was sooo boring, I could have left in the middle of the film and not care less about what was happening to the characters. I love the cast but everything was soo unfunny. I left the movie fealing like I learned nothing knew. The movie is trying to be this inclusive thing but with all the jokes directing into the old steriotypes it contradicted its self the hold time. Margot is beyond beautiful and calling her self ugly in the movie even though she is \"The Barbie\" isn't so clevver as they think it is, not even with the narrator. I Love Greta but it dosen't feel like her. Kinda like with Wednesday not feeling like a Tim Burton thing. But good job with the marketing, it got me.\n",

            "Rese√±a 14: Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.\n",

The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down. One positive is that it had some funny parts, but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline!!\n",

            "While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice \"Barbie World\" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish \"What Was I Made For?\" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.\n",

            "Rese√±a 18: I walked out of the theatre thinking, \"Yeah, I had a good time in that movie\". But as the day went on I kind had that \"Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.\"The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?\n",

            "Rese√±a 19: Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).\n",

She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect again.Barbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer. The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish.

Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing.

            "Rese√±a 22: Barbie, a movie about the beloved doll and all her identities and her friends, what could go wrong? A lot apparently. It started with voice over narration and went downhill from there. There was too much telling rather than showing. Most of this movie constantly explained everything and often told me how I should feel about it. The writing felt like it was trying too hard to be profound and tried to oversimplify complex subjects and gender roles. There were some funny moments, but a lot of the humor and story were far from subtle. I never felt drawn into the characters and what they were experiencing. The story lacked stakes. I didn't care about Barbie or Ken. In the right hands, this movie could have been fun. But Barbie didn't seem to know what it wanted to be or what story it wanted to tell.\n",

I couldn't stand it. Barbie's world and attitude was a constant bummer. Ken's attitude was sour. For the next hour (and more) the movie just lived in negativity.I bought tickets to this show a month ago. And, I saw it the day before the official opening day. I was very excited about this movie. And, I was playing the music (Dua Lipa) song almost every day. I was really excited for this movie - and was looking forward to something very positive. But, the vast majority of the movie was the \"conflict\" part of the writing. It was just too much! The movie didn't need to go that way, that far, that fast.

As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, \"Barbie,\" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.\n",

            "Rese√±a 25: Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.\n",

            "Rese√±a 26: Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that \"women rule and men drool\" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point. Patriarchy may give men privilege but it ultimately hurts them, too - pressuring them to conform to a rigid idea of manhood and silencing their self-expression.I am living for the fact that this movie is unapologetic about showing the absurdity of it all. I would have given it a 10 if it weren't for the cringe worthy Ken dance number. It was the only weak part of the movie. But otherwise, Bravo!\n",

            "Rese√±a 27: I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.\n",

            "Rese√±a 28: This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from \"Barbieland\" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon. The pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched, but purely as a cinematic experience I will never forget this movie.\n",

            "Rese√±a 29: Its like watching at \"Truman's show\" but all the set it's pink color with a hint of extreme feminist ideas. I grew up with barbie dolls and I felt very disappointed, I was expecting a different kind of story, the ending was the worst. I think the message should be more with the real feminist concept of Simone de Bouvoir, we all deserve the same rights. In the end Instead of just Barbie Land they should changed as; Barbie and Ken Land.Definitely is not the best movie of Greta.I enjoyed the music, the set and loved the clothes. Although I excepted to hear the Aqua song! Why it wasn't played in the movie.Anyway its not a bad movie, it's just good movie.\n",

            "Rese√±a 30: I saw this recently on streaming after hearing so much hype about how it was so important and such an incredible movie. After I watched it I wondered if I'd ordered the wrong movie. The whole thing was just lame unfunny jokes, a convoluted plot line, bland acting and mixed messaging which seems to be trying to be positive for women but are unintentionally negative - especially at the end with how the Barbies trick the Kens, I mean is the positive message for my daughter meant to be to exploit men by buttering them up? Er what?Reviews for this were glowingly positive and I pretty much disagreed with all of them, but even the negative reviews praised the set design and Barbie land, personally I didn't see the big deal, like they copied how the dream houses look and made a set of it. Whoopty do.The two stars are mostly for Ryan Gosling and Allan (I forget the actors name) as they were the best part of the movie, even though Gosling Ken strolling was sad to me. Which is ironic given it was meant to be a movie about empowering women.Disappointing and I expect this movie to be re evaluated as bad in the future.\n",
            "Sentimiento: NEU\n",
            "Rese√±a 31: I have been waiting for this to release for so long and I finally got to watch it today. I absolutely loved it! It was fun, it had Margot Robbie (and extra stuff for Tarantino's out there if you know what I mean) And it had some absolute bangers! What more could you want from a new summer classic?Honestly the depth of the story ain't there but what do you expect from a film about a Barbie? Lol I'll probably go back and watch it again tbh and I'll probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as I did rather enjoy it (seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing) there are some touching moments where Robbie really shines I just wish there were a little more because as everyone I absolutely adore Margot and her films.Anyway Barbie is a blast. It's a definite recommend on my list.\n",

            "Rese√±a 32: The first reason to go see it:It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!\n",

            "Rese√±a 33: The film does not live up to the marketing. Its about as subtle as a steamroller and deep as a puddle. There must be primary school books with more depth and nuance than this film.The music is good and the plot moves along at pace but its like it was written by an angsty tween. \"Yay feminism\" is about as deep as the message gets and its pretty much the entire purpose and plot of the film. It doesn't offer up anything to think about, just a bubblegum world that is just a carbon copy of the toys.With all the \"Barbenhiemer\" hype and marketing I expected more from the movie, Oppenheimer and Barbie are about as polar opposites of film-making as its possible to get.\n",
            "Sentimiento: P\n",
            "Rese√±a 34: Unfortunately, most reviews that I've read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film. It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as \"stupid\". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn't offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.The film was fun, emotional, moving, sad and empowering in many ways. I must admit I hadn't expected to enjoy this film, but wow, what a surprise!\n",

            "Rese√±a 35: Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.\n",

            "Rese√±a 36: The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.\n",

            "Rese√±a 37: I cried, I laughed, I dance and I did sing too. What a joyful time I had at the movies watching Barbie. This is a movie to celebrate how diverse and complicated are the humans. The cinematography is a outstanding as well as the production design and the vestuary. The casting seems like made in heaven. I recommend this movie for 11+ years old. And if you have a teen at home, take her with you. Barbie goes from fun to introspection and I love a good comedy that makes you think. Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken, he does everything in this movie and shines every time he shows up. Margo is a perfect Barbie and got a real sense of the relevance this is going to have.\n",
            "Sentimiento: P\n",
            "Rese√±a 38: The movie isn't as fantastic as it was hyped to be. Its deconstruction of patriarchy and satire fall short of what was expected. Instead, it seems to remain on a rather superficial level of \"girls can do anything\" and \"find yourself.\" The most controversial aspect of the Barbie character, whether it exacerbates women's appearance anxiety, is hardly mentioned at all. In my view, it's essentially a reiteration of the same old themes, just presented in updated ways. However, considering Hollywood's consistent conservatism and focus on profits, I appreciate that this is a brave attempt at expressing feminism within the world's most profit-driven film industry.\n",

            "Rese√±a 39: It's weird seeing a movie that puts gay male culture front and centre of a lesbian-free world.This highlights the movie's sloppy construction, it doesn't know what it wants to be.The movie starts with a homage to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey resulting in every child rejecting baby dolls. What started out as amusing is so committed to a shot-for-shot homage it becomes a sinister, disturbing message that closely matches 2001's statement of the human race discovering weapons.A chase scene in an office makes no sense.A key character at her kitchen table is a touching moment but the way she is found has no internal logic.Having seen this film with various friends I noticed audiences were left cold at same points.Why would Ken run into plastic moulded waves in an environment he lives in? One of many 'jokes' that fails to land such as the cartoon car crashes, the boardroom whisper gag among others.The movie has some cute moments having people enact doll play.That absence of internal logic reveals this movie has no idea what it wants to be.\n",

What hit me the most is that I was only expecting the kind of adult humor in that Barbie song \"You can brush my hair undress me everywhere,\" but at some point I realize it's way more than that. The movie was hilarious that I remember my mouth was opened laughing the whole time you know, all the Barbie jokes. And it's so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it's so beautiful. Yet, it's such a deep movie that it told things we almost be numb to. It said it out loud to remind us who we are and what are our worth and where are we going and everything. It's a movie about love. I cried so hard and laughed so hard. It's a masterpiece.\n",
